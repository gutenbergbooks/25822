<h2>HOW NEWSPAPERS ARE MADE.</h2>
</div>

<p>We will suppose that it
is a great newspaper,
in a great city, printing
daily 25,000, or
more, copies. Here
it is, with wide columns,
with small, compact type, with very little space
wasted in head lines, eight large pages of it, something
like 100,000 words printed upon it, and sold
for four cents&mdash;25,000 words for a cent. It is a
great institution&mdash;a power greater than a hundred
banking-houses, than a hundred politicians, than a
hundred clergymen. It collects and scatters news;
it instructs and entertains with valuable and sprightly
articles; it forms and concentrates public opinion; it
in one way or another, brings its influence to bear
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
upon millions of people, in its own, and other lands.
Who would not like to know something about it?
</p>
<p>And there is Tom, first of all, who declares that he
is going to be a business man, and who already has a
bank-book with a good many dollars entered on its
credit side&mdash;there is Tom, I say, asking first of
all: &#8220;How much does it cost? and where does the
money come from? and is it a paying concern?&#8221;
Tom shall not have his questions expressly answered;
for it isn&#8217;t exactly his business; but here are some
points from which he may figure:
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>How much does it cost?</i>&#8221; Well, there is the publishing
department, with an eminent business man at
its head, with two or three good business men for his
assistants, and with several excellent clerks and
other employès. Then there is the Editor-in-Chief,
and the Managing Editor, and the City Editor, and
a corps of editors of different departments, besides
reporters&mdash;thirty or forty men in all, each with some
special literary gift. Then there are thirty or forty
men setting type; a half-dozen proof-readers; a
half-dozen stereotypers; the engineer and foreman
and assistants below stairs, who do the printing;
and several men employed in the mailing department.
Then there are tons and tons of paper to be
bought each week; ink, new type, heavy bills for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
postage; many hundreds of dollars a week for telegraphic
dispatches; and the interest on the money
invested in an expensive building; expensive
machinery, and an expensive stock of printers&#8217;
materials&mdash;nothing being said of the pay of correspondents
of the paper at the State Capitol, at
Washington, at London, at Paris, etc. Tom is
enough of a business man, already, I know, to figure
up the weekly expenses of such an establishment at
several thousands of dollars&mdash;a good many hundreds
at each issue of the paper.

<p>&#8220;<i>And where does the money come from?</i>&#8221; Partly
from the sale of papers. Only four cents apiece,
and only a part of that goes to the paper; but, then,
25,000 times, say two-and-a-half cents, is $625, which
it must be confessed, is quite a respectable sum for
quarter-dimes to pile up in a single day. But the
greater part of the money comes from advertisements.
Nearly half of the paper is taken up with them. If
you take a half-dozen lines to the advertising clerk,
he will charge you two or three dollars; and there
are several hundred times as much as your small
advertisement in each paper. So you may guess
what an income the advertising yields. And the
larger, the more popular, and the more widely read
the paper, the better will be the prices which advertisers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
will pay, and the more will be the advertisements.
And so the publisher tries to sell as many
papers as he can, partly because of the money which
he gets for them, but more, because the more he
sells the more advertising will he get, and the better
rates will he charge for it. So, Tom, if you ever
become the publisher of a newspaper, you must set
your heart on getting an editor who will make a paper
that will sell&mdash;whatever else he does or does <i>not</i> do.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>And is it a paying concern?</i>&#8221; Well, I don&#8217;t think
the editors think they get very large pay, nor the correspondents,
nor the reporters, nor the printers, nor the
pressmen. They work incessantly; it is an intense sort
of work; the hours are long and late; the chances of
premature death are multiplied. I think they will all
say: &#8220;We aren&#8217;t in this business for the money that is
in it; we are in it for the influence of it, for the art of
it, for the love of it; but then, we are very glad to
get our checks all the same.&#8221; As to whether the
paper pays the men who own it&mdash;which was Tom&#8217;s
question: I think that that &#8220;depends&#8221; a great deal
on the state of trade, on the state of politics, and on
the degree to which the paper will, or will not, scruple
to do mean things. A great many papers would
pay better, if they were meaner. It would be a great
deal easier to make a good paper, if you did not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
have to sell it. When, then, Jonathan shall have
become a minister, he doesn&#8217;t want to bear down
too hard on a &#8220;venal press&#8221; in his Fast Day and
Thanksgiving sermons. Perhaps, by that time, Tom
will be able to explain why.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>How, now, is this paper made?</i>&#8221; &#8220;But,&#8221; interrupts
Jonathan, &#8220;before they make it, I should like
to know where they get the 100,000 words to put into
it; I have been cudgeling my brains for now two
weeks to get words enough to fill a four page composition&mdash;say
200 words, <i>coarse</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The words which are put into it are, besides the
advertisements, chiefly: 1. News; 2. Letters and
articles on various subjects; 3. Editorial articles,
reviews, and notes; 4. Odds and ends.
</p>
<p>The &#8220;<i>letters and articles on various subjects</i>&#8221; come
from all sorts of people: some from great writers
who get large pay for even a brief communication;
some from paid correspondents in various parts of
the world; some from all sorts of people who wish
to proclaim to the world some grievance of theirs, or
to enlighten the world with some brilliant idea of
theirs&mdash;which generally loses its luster the day the
article is printed. A large proportion of letters and
articles from this last class of people get sold for
waste-paper before the printer sees them. This is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
one considerable source of income to the paper, of
which I neglected to tell Tom.

<p>As for the &#8220;<i>odds and ends</i>&#8221;&mdash;extracts from other

tastefully scattered here and there through the paper,
come under the reader&#8217;s eye, they make, I am bound
to say, a great deal of very hearty laughter which is
not that laughter of ridicule which the sight of him

OFFICE OF THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>About the &#8220;<i>news</i>,&#8221; I must speak more fully. The
&#8220;<i>editorial articles, reviews, and notes</i>,&#8221; we shall happen
upon when we visit the office.
</p>
<p>A part of the news comes by telegraph from all
parts of the world. Some of it is telegraphed to the
paper by its correspondents, and the editors call it
&#8220;special,&#8221; because it is especially to them. Perhaps
there is something in it which none of the other
papers have yet heard of. But the general telegraphic
news, from the old-world and the new, is
gathered up by the &#8220;Associated Press.&#8221; That is to
say, the leading papers form an Association and
appoint men to send them news from the chief points
in America and in Europe. These representatives
of the Associated Press are very enterprising, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
they do not allow much news of importance to escape
them. The salaries of these men, and the cost of the
telegraphic dispatches, are divided up among the
papers of the Association, so that the expense to each
paper is comparatively small. Owing to this association
of papers, hundreds of papers throughout the
country publish a great deal of matter on the same
day which is word-for-word alike.
</p>
<p>Two devices in this matter of Associated Press
dispatches save so much labor, that I think you will
like me to describe them.
</p>
<p>One is this: Suppose there are a dozen papers in
the same city which are entitled to the Associated
Press dispatches. Instead of making a dozen separate
copies, which might vary through mistakes,
one writing answers for all the dozen. First, a sheet
of prepared tissue paper is laid down, then a sheet of
a black, smutty sort of paper, then two sheets of
tissue paper, then a sheet of black paper, and so on,
until as many sheets of tissue paper have been piled
up, as there are copies wanted. Upon the top sheet
of paper, the message is written, not with pen, or
pencil, but with a hard bone point, which presses so
hard that the massive layers of tissue paper take off
from the black paper a black line wherever the
bone point has pressed. Thus a dozen pages are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
written with one writing, and off they go, just alike,
to the several newspaper offices. The printers call
this queer, tissue-paper copy&mdash;&#8220;manifold.&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<img src='images/illus-006.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
REGULAR CONTRIBUTORS
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The other device is a telegraphic one. Suppose
the Associated Press agent in New York is sending
a dispatch to the Boston papers. There are papers
belonging to the Association at, say, New Haven,
Hartford, Springfield and Worcester. Instead of
sending a message to each of these points, also,
the message goes to Boston, and operators at
New Haven, Hartford, Springfield, and Worcester,
<i>listen to it as it goes through</i>, and copy it off. Thus
one operator at New York is able to talk to perhaps
a score of papers, in various parts of New England,
or elsewhere, at once.
</p>
<p>But in a large city there is a great deal of city
and suburban news. Take for example, New York;
and there is that great city, and Brooklyn, and Jersey
City, and Hoboken, and Newark, and Elizabeth,
to be looked after, as well as many large villages near
at hand. And there is great competition between the
papers, which shall get the most, the exactest, and
the freshest, news. Consequently, each day, a leading
New York paper will publish a page or more of
local news. The City Editor has charge of collecting
this news. He has, perhaps, twenty or twenty-five
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
men to help him&mdash;some in town, and others
in the suburbs.
</p>
<p>His plan for news collecting will be something
like this: He will have his secretary keep two
great journals, with a page in each devoted to each
day. One of these, the &#8220;blotter,&#8221; will be to write
things in which are going to happen. Everything that
is going to happen to-morrow, the next day, the next,
and so on, the secretary will make a memorandum of
or paste a paragraph in about upon the page for the
day on which the event will happen. Whatever he,
or the City Editor, hears or reads of, that is going to
happen, they thus put down in advance, until by and
by, the book gets fairly fat and stout with slips which
have been pasted in. But, this morning, the City
Editor wants to lay out to-day&#8217;s work. So his secretary
turns to the &#8220;blotter,&#8221; at to-day&#8217;s page, and
copies from it into to-day&#8217;s page in the second
book all the things to happen to-day&mdash;a dozen, or
twenty, or thirty&mdash;a ship to be launched, a race to
come off, a law-case to be opened, a criminal to be
executed, such and such important meetings to be
held, and so on. By this plan, nothing escapes the
eye of the City Editor who, at the side of each thing
to happen, writes the name of the reporter whom he
wishes to have write the event up. This second book
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
is called the &#8220;assignment book;&#8221; and, when it is
made out, the reporters come in, find their orders
upon it, and go out for their day&#8217;s work, returning
again at evening for any new assignments. Besides
this, they, and the City Editor, keep sharp ears
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
and eyes for anything new; and so, amongst them,
the city and suburbs are ransacked for every item of
news of any importance. The City Editor is a sort
of general. He keeps a close eye on his men. He
finds out what they can best do, and sets them at
that. He gives the good workers better and better
work; the poor ones he gradually works out of the
office. Those who make bad mistakes, or fail to get
the news, which some other paper gets, are frequently
&#8220;suspended,&#8221; or else discharged out-and-out. Failing
to get news which other papers get, is called
being &#8220;beaten,&#8221; and no reporter can expect to get
badly &#8220;beaten&#8221; many times without losing his position.

<p>And now, Tom, and Jonathan, and even little Nell,

TYPE-SETTER&#8217;S CASE IN PI.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>It is six o&#8217;clock. The streets are dark. The gaslights
are glaring from hundreds of lamp-posts. Do
you see the highest stories of all those buildings
brilliant with lights? Those are the type-setters&#8217;
rooms of as many great newspapers. In a twinkling
we are several stories up toward the top of one of
these buildings. These are the Editorial Rooms.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
We&#8217;ll make ourselves invisible, so that they&#8217;ll not
suspect our presence, and will do to-night just as
they always do.

TYPE-SETTERS&#8217; ROOM.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Up over our heads, in the room of the type-setters,
are a hundred columns, or more, of articles already
set&mdash;enough to make two or three newspapers. The
Foreman of the type-setters makes copies of these
on narrow strips of paper with a hand-press, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
sends them down to the Editor-in-Chief. These
copies on narrow strips of paper, are called &#8220;proofs,&#8221;
because, when they are read over, the person reading
them can see if the type has been set correctly&mdash;can
prove the correctness or incorrectness of the type-setting.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
TAKING &#8220;PROOFS.&#8221;
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The Editor-in-Chief runs rapidly through these
proofs, and marks, against here and there one,
&#8220;<i>Must</i>,&#8221; which means that it &#8220;must&#8221; be published
in to-morrow&#8217;s paper. Against other articles he
marks, &#8220;<i>Desirable</i>,&#8221; which means that the articles
are &#8220;desirable&#8221; to be used, if there is room for
them. Many of the articles he makes no mark
against, because they can wait, perhaps a week, or a
month. By having a great many articles in type all
the time, they never lack&mdash;Jonathan will be glad to
know&mdash;for something to put into the paper. Jonathan
might well take the hint, and write his compositions
well in advance. Against some of the articles,
the word &#8220;<i>Reference</i>&#8221; is written, which indicates that
when the article is published an editorial article or
note with &#8220;reference&#8221; to it must also be published.
Before the Editor-in-Chief is through, perhaps he
marks against one or two articles the word &#8220;<i>Kill</i>,&#8221;
which means that the article is, after all, not wanted
in the paper, and that the type of it may be taken
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
apart&mdash;the type-setters say &#8220;distributed&#8221;&mdash;without
being printed.

IN THE STEREOTYPERS&#8217; ROOM.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>When the Editor-in-Chief is through with the
proofs, perhaps he has a consultation with the Managing
Editor&mdash;the first editor in authority after him&mdash;about
some plans for to-night&#8217;s paper, or for to-morrow,
or for next week. Perhaps, then, he summons
in the Night Editor. The Night Editor is the
man who stays until almost morning, who overlooks
everything that goes into the paper, and who puts
everything in according to the orders of the Editor-in-Chief,
or of the Managing Editor. Well, he tells the
Night Editor how he wants to-morrow&#8217;s paper made,
what articles to make the longest, and what ones
to put in the most important places in the paper.
Then, perhaps, the City Editor comes knocking at
the door, and enters, and he and the Editor-in-Chief
talk over some stirring piece of city news, and
decide what to say in the editorial columns about it.
</p>
<p>After the Editor-in-Chief has had these consultations,
perhaps he begins to dictate to his secretary
letters to various persons, the secretary taking them
down in short-hand, as fast as he can talk, and afterwards
copying them out and sending them off. That
is the sort of letter-writing which would suit little Nell&mdash;just
to say off the letter, and not to have to write
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
it&mdash;which, in her case, means &#8220;printing&#8221; it in
great, toilsome capitals. After dictating perhaps
a dozen letters, it may be that the Editor-in-Chief
dictates in the same manner, an editorial article, or
some other matter which he wishes to have appear
in the paper. Thus he spends several hours&mdash;perhaps
the whole night&mdash;in seeing people, giving
directions, dictating letters and articles, laying out
new plans, and exercising a general headship over all
things.
</p>
<p>Turning, now, from his room, we observe in the
great room of the editors, a half dozen men or more
seated at their several desks&mdash;the Managing Editor
and the Night Editor about their duties; two or
three men looking over telegraph messages and
getting them ready for the type-setters; two or three
men writing editorial, and other articles.
</p>
<p>From this room we turn to the great room of the
City Department. There is the City Editor, in his
little, partitioned-off room, writing an editorial, we
will suppose, on the annual report of the City Treasurer,
which has to-day been given to the public.
At desks, about the great room, a half-dozen reporters
are writing up the news which they have
been appointed to collect; and another, and another,
comes in every little while.

</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></div>
<p>Over there, is the little, partitioned-off room for
the Assistant City Editor. It is this man&#8217;s duty,
with his assistant, to prepare for the type-setters all
the articles which come from the City Department.
There are stacks and stacks of them. Each reporter
thinks his subject is the most important, and writes it
up fully; and, when it is all together, perhaps there
is a third or a half more than there is room in the
paper to print. So the Assistant City Editor, and his
Assistant, who come to the office at about five o&#8217;clock
in the afternoon, read it all over carefully, correct it,
cut out that which it is not best to use, group all the
news of the same sort so that it may come under
one general head, put on suitable titles, decide what
sort of type to put it in, etc.,&mdash;a good night&#8217;s work
for both of them. They also write little introductions
to the general subjects, and so harmonize and
modify the work of twenty or twenty-five reporters, as
to make it read almost as if it were written by one
man, with one end in view.
</p>
<p>The editors of the general news have to do much
the same thing by the letters of correspondents, and
by the telegraphic dispatches.
</p>
<p>While this sort of work goes on, hour after hour,
with many merry laughs and many good jokes interspersed
to make the time fly the swifter, we will
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
wander about the establishment. Here, in the top
story of the building, is the room of the type-setters.
Every few minutes, from down-stairs in the Counting
Room, comes a package of advertisements to be put
into type; and from the Editorial Rooms a package
of news and general articles for the same purpose.
They do not trouble to send them up by a messenger.
A tube, with wind blown through it very fast, brings
up every little while a little leathern bag, in which
are the advertisements or the articles&mdash;the &#8220;copy&#8221;
as the type-setters call it.
</p>
<p>In this room are thirty or forty type-setters. Each
one of them has his number. When the copy comes
up, a man takes it and cuts it up into little bits, as
much as will make, say, a dozen lines in the paper,
and numbers the bits&mdash;&#8220;one,&#8221; &#8220;two,&#8221; etc., to the
end of the article. Type-setter after type-setter comes
and takes one of these little bits, and in a few
moments sets the type for it, and lays it down in a
long trough, with the number of the bit of copy laid
by the side of it. We will suppose that an article
has been cut up into twenty bits. Twenty men will
each in a few moments be setting one of these bits,
and, in a few minutes more they will come and lay
down the type and the number of the bit in the long
trough, in just the right order of the number of the
bits&mdash;&#8220;one,&#8221; &#8220;two,&#8221; etc. Then all the type will be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
slid together, and a long article will thus be set in a
few minutes, which it would take one or two men
several hours to set. It is by this means that long
articles can in so short a time be put into type.
Each man who takes a bit, has to make his last line
fill out to the end of the line; and, because there are
sometimes not words enough, so that he has to fill
out with some extra spaces between the words, you
may often see in any large daily paper every two
inches, or so, a widely spaced line or two showing
how the type-setter had to fill out his bit with spaces&mdash;only
he would call the bit, a &#8220;take.&#8221;
</p>

PRINTING PRESSES OF THE PAST AND PRESENT
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>I said that each type-setter has his number. We
will suppose that this man, next to us, is number
&#8220;twenty-five.&#8221; Then he is provided with a great
many pieces of metal, just the width of a column,
with his number made on them&mdash;thus: &#8220;TWENTY-FIVE.&#8221;
Every time he sets a new bit of copy, he
puts one of these &#8220;twenty-fives&#8221; at the top; and
when all the bits of type in the long trough are slid
together the type is broken up every two inches
or so, with &#8220;twenty-five,&#8221; &#8220;thirty-seven,&#8221; &#8220;two,&#8221;
&#8220;eleven,&#8221; and so on, at the top of the bits which the
men, whose numbers these are, have set. When a
proof of the article is taken, these several numbers
appear; and, if there are mistakes, it appears from
these numbers, what type-setters made them, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
they have to correct them. Also, of each article, a
single &#8220;proof&#8221; is taken on colored paper. These
colored paper &#8220;proofs&#8221; are cut up the next day, and
all the pieces marked &#8220;twenty-five,&#8221; &#8220;thirty-seven,&#8221;
and so on, go to the men who have these numbers,
and when pasted together show how much type,
number &#8220;twenty-five,&#8221; &#8220;thirty-seven,&#8221; and so on, are
to be paid for setting&mdash;for the type-setters are paid
according to the amount of type which they set.

FAC-SIMILE OF &#8220;PROOF&#8221; SHOWING &#8220;TAKES.&#8221;
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>As fast as the proofs are taken they go into the
room of the proof-readers to be corrected. The bits
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
of copy are pasted together again, and one man holds
the copy while another reads the proof aloud. The
man holding the copy notices any points in which the
proof does not read like the copy, and tells the man
who is reading it. The man reading it corrects the
variations from copy, and corrects all the other mistakes
which he can discover, and then the type-setters
have to change the type so as to make it right.
There the proof readers sit hard at work, reading
incredibly fast, and making rapid and accurate corrections;
then the &#8220;copy&#8221; is locked up, and no one
can get at it, except the Managing Editor or Editor-in-Chief
gives an order to see it. This precaution is
taken, in order to make certain who is responsible
for any mistakes which appear in the paper&mdash;the
editors, or the type-setters.
</p>
<p>By this time it is nearly midnight, and the editors,
type-setters, etc., take their lunches. They either go
out to restaurants for them, or have them sent in&mdash;hot
coffee, sandwiches, fruit, etc.&mdash;a good meal for
which they are all glad to stop.
</p>
<p>And now the Foreman of the type-setters sends to
the Night Editor that matter enough is in type to
begin the &#8220;make-up&#8221;&mdash;that is, to put together the
first pages of the paper. There the beautiful type
stands, in long troughs, all corrected now, the great
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
numbers of the type-setters removed from between
the bits of type&mdash;the whole ready to be arranged into
page after page of the paper. So the Night Editor
makes a list of the articles which he wants on the
page which is to be made up; the Foreman puts
them in in the order which the Night Editor indicates;
the completed page is wedged securely into
an iron frame, and then is ready to be stereotyped.

<p>The room of the stereotypers is off by itself. There
is a furnace in it, and a great caldron of melted type
metal. They take the page of the paper which has
just been made up; put it
on a hot steam chest; spat
down upon the type
some thick pulpy paper
soaked so as to make it
fit around the type; spread
plaster of Paris on the back, so as to keep the pulpy
paper in shape; and put the whole under the press
which more perfectly squeezes the pulpy paper down
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
upon the type, and causes it to take a more perfect
impression of the type. The heat of the steam
chest warms the type, and quickly dries the pulpy
paper and the plaster of Paris. Then the pulpy paper
is taken off, and curved with just such a curve as
the cylinders of the printing-press have, and melted
type metal is poured over it, which cools in a moment;
when, lo, there is a curving plate of type-metal just
like the type! The whole process of making this plate
takes only a few minutes. They use such plates as
these, rather than type, in printing the great papers
chiefly for reasons like these: 1. Because plates save
the wear of type; 2. Because they are easier
handled; 3. Because they can be made curving, to
fit the cylinders of the printing presses as it would be
difficult to arrange the type; 4. Because several
plates can be made from the same type, and hence
several presses can be put at work at the same time
printing the same paper; 5. Because, if anything
needs to be added to the paper, after the presses have
begun running, the type being left up-stairs can be
changed and new plates made, so that the presses
need stop only a minute for the new plates to be put
in&mdash;which is a great saving of time.
</p>
<p>But, coming down into the Editorial Rooms again&mdash;business
Tom, and thoughtful Jonathan, and sleepy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
little Nell&mdash;all is excitement. Telegrams have just
come in telling of the wreck of an ocean steamer, and
men are just being dispatched to the steamer&#8217;s office
to learn all the particulars possible, and to get, if it
may be, a list of the passengers and crew. And
now, just in the midst of this, a fire-alarm strikes, and
in a few moments the streets are as light as day with
the flames of a burning warehouse in the heart of the
business part of the city. More men are sent off to
that; and, what with the fire and the wreck, every
reporter, every copy-editor, every type-setter and
proof-reader are put to their hardest work until the
last minute before the last page of the paper must
be sent down to the press-rooms. Then, just at
the last, perhaps the best writer in the office dashes
off a &#8220;leader&#8221; on the wreck sending a few lines at
a time to the type-setters&mdash;a leader which, though
thought out, written, set, corrected, and stereotyped
in forty minutes, by reason of its clearness, its
wisdom, and its brilliancy, is copied far and wide,
and leads the public generally to decide where to fix
the blame, and how to avoid a like accident again.
There is the work of the &#8220;<i>editorial articles, reviews,
and notes</i>&#8221;&mdash;to comment on events which happen,
and to influence the minds of the public as
the editorial management of the paper regards to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
be wise. There is all sorts of this editorial writing&mdash;fun,
politics, science, literature, religion&mdash;and he
who says, with his pen, the say of such a newspaper,
wields an influence which no mind can measure.

<p>Well, the fire, and the wreck, have thoroughly
awakened even little Nell. And so down, down we
go, far under ground, to the Press-rooms. There the
noise is deafening. Two or three presses are at
work. At one end of the press is a great roll of paper
as big as a hogshead and a mile or more long.
This immense roll of paper is unwinding very fast,
and going in at one end of the machine; while at the
other end, faster than you can count, are coming out
finished papers&mdash;the papers printed on both sides,
cut up, folded, and counted, without the touch of a
hand&mdash;a perfect marvel and miracle of human ingenuity.
The sight is a sight to remember for a lifetime.
Upon what one here sees, hinges very much

<p>And now, here come the mailing clerks, to get
their papers to send off&mdash;with great accuracy and

come the newsboys, each for his bundle; and soon

THE FIRST UMBRELLA.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>About one hundred and thirty years ago, an
Englishman named Jonas Hanway, who had
been a great traveller, went out for a walk in the city
of London, carrying an umbrella over his head.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
<a name='linki_17' id='linki_17'></a>
<img src='images/illus-018.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
WHAT JONAS SAW ADOWN THE FUTURE.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Every time he went out for a walk, if it rained or if
the sun shone hotly, he carried this umbrella, and all
along the streets, wherever he appeared, men and boys
hooted and laughed; while women and girls, in doorways
and windows, giggled and stared at the strange
sight, for this Jonas Hanway was the first man to
commonly carry an umbrella in the city of London,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
and everybody, but himself, thought it was a most
ridiculous thing to do.
</p>
<p>But he seems to have been a man of strength and
courage, and determined not to give up his umbrella
even if all London made fun of him. Perhaps, in imagination,
he saw adown the future, millions of umbrellas&mdash;umbrellas
enough to shelter the whole island of
England from rain.
</p>
<p>Whether he did foresee the innumerable posterity
of his umbrella or not, the &#8220;millions&#8221; of umbrellas
have actually come to pass.
</p>
<p>But Jonas Hanway was by no means the first man
in the world to carry an umbrella. As I have already
mentioned, he had travelled a great deal, and had
seen umbrellas in China, Japan, in India and Africa,
where they had been in use for so many hundreds of
years that nobody knows when the first one was
made. So long ago as Nineveh existed in its splendor,
umbrellas were used, as they are yet to be found
sculptured on the ruins of that magnificent capital of
Assyria, as well as on the monuments of Egypt which
are very, very old; and your ancient history will tell
you that the city of Nineveh was founded not long
after the flood. Perhaps it was that great rain, of
forty days and forty nights, that put in the minds of
Noah, or some of his sons, the idea to build an umbrella!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>Although here in America the umbrella means nothing
but an umbrella, it is quite different in some of the
far Eastern countries. In some parts of Asia and Africa
no one but a royal personage is allowed to carry
an umbrella. In Siam it is a mark of rank. The
King&#8217;s umbrella is composed of one umbrella above
another, a series of circles, while that of a nobleman
consists of but one circle. In Burmah it is much the
same as in Siam while the Burmese King has an umbrella-title
that is very comical: &#8220;Lord of the twenty-four
umbrellas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The reason why the people of London ridiculed
Jonas Hanway was because at that time it was considered
only proper that an umbrella should be carried
by a woman, and for a man to make use of one
was very much as if he had worn a petticoat.
</p>
<p>There is in one of the Harleian MSS. a curious picture
showing an Anglo-Saxon gentleman walking out,
with his servant behind him carrying an umbrella;
the drawing was probably made not far from five hundred
years ago, when the umbrella was first introduced
into England. Whether this gentleman and his servant
created as much merriment as Mr. Hanway did,
I do not know; neither can I tell you why men from
that time on did not continue to use the umbrella.
If I were to make a &#8220;guess&#8221; about it, I should say
that they thought it would not be &#8220;proper,&#8221; for it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
considered an unmanly thing to carry one until a hundred
years ago when the people of this country first
began to use them. And it was not until twenty
years later, say in the year 1800, that the &#8220;Yankees&#8221;
began to make their own umbrellas. But since that
time there have been umbrellas and umbrellas!

LORD OF THE TWENTY-FOUR UMBRELLAS.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The word umbrella comes from the Latin word <i>umbra</i>,
which means a &#8220;little shade;&#8221; but the name,
most probably, was introduced into the English language
from the Italian word <i>ombrella</i>. Parasol means
&#8220;to ward off the sun,&#8221; and another very pretty name,
not much used by Americans, for a small parasol, is
&#8220;parasolette.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It would be impossible for me to tell you how many
umbrellas are made every year in this country. A
gentleman connected with a large umbrella manufactory
in the city of Philadelphia gave me, as his
estimate, 7,000,000.
</p>
<p>This would allow an umbrella to about one person
in six, according to the census computation which
places the population of the United States at 40,000,000
of people. And one umbrella for every six persons
is certainly not a very generous distribution.
Added to the number made in this country, are about
one-half million which are imported, chiefly from
France and England.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
You who have read &#8220;Robinson Crusoe,&#8221; remember
how he made his umbrella and covered it with skins,
and that is probably the most curious umbrella you
can anywhere read about. Then there have been umbrellas
covered with large feathers that would shed
rain like a &#8220;duck&#8217;s back,&#8221; and umbrellas with coverings
of oil-cloth, of straw, of paper, of woollen stuffs,
until now, nearly all umbrellas are covered either
with silk, gingham, or alpaca. And this brings
us to the manufacture of umbrellas in Philadelphia,
where there are more made than in any other city
in America.
</p>
<p>If you will take an umbrella in your hand and examine
it, you will see that there are many more different
things used in making it than you at first
supposed.
</p>
<p>First, there are the &#8220;stick,&#8221; made of wood, &#8220;ribs,&#8221;
&#8220;stretchers&#8221; and &#8220;springs&#8221; of steel; the &#8220;runner,&#8221;
&#8220;runner notch,&#8221; the &#8220;ferule,&#8221; &#8220;cap,&#8221; &#8220;bands&#8221; and
&#8220;tips&#8221; of brass or nickel; then there are the covering,
the runner &#8220;guard&#8221; which is of silk or
leather, the &#8220;inside cap,&#8221; the oftentimes fancy handle,
which may be of ivory, bone, horn, walrus tusk,
or even mother-of-pearl, or some kind of metal, and,
if you will look sharply, you will find a rivet put in
deftly here and there.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>For the &#8220;sticks&#8221; a great variety of wood is used;
although all the wood must be hard, firm, tough, and
capable of receiving both polish and staining. The
cheaper sticks are sawed out of plank, chiefly, of
maple and iron wood. They are then
&#8220;turned&#8221; (that is made round), polished
and stained. The &#8220;natural sticks,&#8221;
not very long ago, were all imported
from England. But that has been
changed, and we now send England
a part of our own supply, which consists
principally of hawthorne and
huckleberry, which come from New York and New
Jersey, and of oak, ash, hickory, and wild cherry.

A &#8220;DUCK&#8217;S BACK&#8221; UMBRELLA.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>If you were to see these sticks, often crooked and
gnarled, with a piece of the root left on, you would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
think they would make very shabby sticks for umbrellas.
But they are sent to a factory where they
are steamed and straitened, and then to a carver,
who cuts the gnarled root-end into the image of a
dog or horse&#8217;s head, or any one of the thousand and
one designs that you may see, many of which are exceedingly
ugly. The artist has kindly made a picture
for you of a &#8220;natural&#8221; stick just as it is brought
from the ground where it grows, and, then again, the
same stick after it has been prepared for the umbrella.
</p>
<p>Of the imported &#8220;natural&#8221; sticks, the principal
are olive, ebony, furze, snakewood, pimento, cinnamon,
partridge, and bamboo. Perhaps you do not
understand that a &#8220;natural&#8221; stick is one that has
been a young tree, having grown to be just large
enough for an umbrella stick, when it was pulled up,
root and all, or with at least a part of the root. If,
when you buy an umbrella that has the stick bent
into a deep curve at the bottom for the handle, you
may feel quite sure that it is of partridge wood, which
does not grow large enough to furnish a knob for a
handle, but, when steamed, admits of being bent.
</p>
<p>The &#8220;runner,&#8221; &#8220;ferule,&#8221; &#8220;cap,&#8221; &#8220;band,&#8221; etc.,
form what is called umbrella furniture and for these
articles there is a special manufactory. Another manufactory
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
cuts and grooves wire of steel into the &#8220;ribs&#8221;
and &#8220;stretchers.&#8221; Formerly
ribs were made out of cane or
whalebone; but these materials
are now seldom used.
When the steel is grooved,
it is called a &#8220;paragon&#8221;
frame, which is the lightest
and best made. It was invented
by an Englishman
named Fox, seventeen or
eighteen years ago. The
latest improvement in the
manufacture of &#8220;ribs&#8221; is to
give them an inward curve
at the bottom, so that they
will fit snugly around the
stick, and which dispenses
with the &#8220;tip cup,&#8221;&mdash;a cup-shaped
piece of metal that
closed over the tips.

<p>Of course we should all like to feel that we Americans
have wit enough to make everything used in
making an umbrella. And so we have in a way; but
it must be confessed that most of the silk used for
umbrella covers, is brought from France. Perhaps
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
if the Cheney Brothers who live at South Manchester in
Connecticut, and
manufacture
such elegant silk
for ladies&#8217; dresses,
and such
lovely scarfs and
cravats for children,
were to try
and make umbrella
silk, we
would soon be
able to say to the
looms of France,
&#8220;No more umbrella
silk for
America, thank
you; we are able
to supply our
own!&#8221;

CUTTING THE COVERS.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>But the &#8220;Yankees&#8221;
do make
all their umbrella
gingham, which is very nice. And one gingham factory
that I have heard about has learned how to dye
gingham such a <i>fast</i> black, that no amount of rain or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
sun changes the color. The gingham is woven into
various widths to suit umbrella frames of different
size, and along each edge of the fabric a border is
formed of large cords. As to alpaca, a dye-house is
being built, not <i>more</i> than a &#8220;thousand miles&#8221; from
Philadelphia on the plan of English dye-houses, so
that our home-made alpacas may be dyed as good
and durable a black as the gingham receives; for
although nobody minds carrying an <i>old</i> umbrella,
nobody likes to carry a faded one. Although there
are umbrellas of blue, green and buff, the favorite
hue seems to be black.
</p>
<p>And now that we have all the materials together to
make an umbrella, let us go into a manufactory and
see exactly how all the pieces are put together.
</p>
<p>First, here is the stick, which must be &#8220;mounted.&#8221;
By that you must understand that there are two
springs to be put in, the ferule put on the top end,
and if the handle is of other material than the stick,
that must be put on.
</p>
<p>The ugliest of all the work is the cutting of the
slots in which the springs are put. These are first cut
by a machine; but if the man who operates it is not
careful, he will get some of his fingers cut off. But
after the slot-cutting machine does its work, there is
yet something to be done by another man with a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
knife before the spring can be put in. After the
springs are set, the ferule is put on, and when natural
sticks are used, as all are of different sizes, it requires
considerable time and care to find a ferule to fit
the stick, as well as in whittling off the end of the
stick to suit the ferule. And before going any farther
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
you will notice that all the counters in the various
work-rooms are carpeted. The carpet prevents the
polished sticks from being scratched, and the dust
from sticking to the umbrella goods.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_22' id='linki_22'></a>
<img src='images/illus-023.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
FINISHING THE HANDLE.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>After the handle is put on the stick and a band
put on for finish or ornament, the stick goes to the
frame-maker, who fastens the stretchers to the ribs,
strings the top end of the ribs on a wire which is
fitted into the &#8220;runner notch;&#8221; then he strings the
lower ends of the &#8220;stretchers&#8221; on a wire and fastens
it in the &#8220;runner,&#8221; and then when both &#8220;runners&#8221;
are securely fixed the umbrella is ready for the cover.
</p>
<p>As this is a very important part of the umbrella,
several men and women are employed in making it.
In the room where the covers are cut, you will at first
notice a great number of V shaped things hanging
against the wall on either side of the long room.
These letter Vs are usually made of wood, tipped all
around with brass or some other fine metal, and are
of a great variety of sizes. They are the umbrella
cover patterns, as you soon make out. To begin with,
the cutter lays his silk or gingham very smoothly
out on a long counter, folding it back and forth until
the fabric lies eight or sixteen times in thickness,
the layers being several yards in length. (But I must
go back a little and tell you that both edges of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
silk, or whatever the cover is to be, has been hemmed
by a woman, on a sewing machine before it is spread
out on the counter). Well, when the cutter finds that
he has the silk smoothly arranged, with the edges
even, he lays on his pattern, and with a sharp knife
quickly draws it along two sides of it, and in a
twinkling you see the pieces for perhaps two umbrellas
cut out; this is so when the silk, or material,
is sixteen layers thick and the umbrella cover is to
have but eight pieces.
</p>
<p>After the cover is cut, each piece is carefully examined
by a woman to see that there are no holes
nor defects in it, for one bad piece would spoil a
whole umbrella.
</p>
<p>Then a man takes the pieces and stretches the
cut edges. This stretching must be so skilfully done
that the whole length of the edge be evenly stretched.
This stretching is necessary in order to secure a good
fit on the frame.
</p>
<p>After this the pieces go to the sewing-room, where
they are sewed together by a woman, on a sewing-machine,
in what is called a &#8220;pudding-bag&#8221; seam.
The sewing-machine woman must have the machine-tension
just right or the thread of the seam will
break when the cover is stretched over the frame.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
SEWING &#8220;PUDDING-BAG&#8221; SEAMS.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The next step in the work is to fasten the cover to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
the frame, which is done by a woman. After the
cover is fastened at the top and bottom, she half
hoists the umbrella, and has a small tool which she
uses to keep the umbrella in that position, then she
fastens the seams to the ribs; and a quick workwoman
will do all this in five minutes, as well as sew
on the tie, which has been made by another pair of
hands. Then the cap is put on and the umbrella is
completed.
</p>
<p>But before it is sent to the salesroom, a woman
smooths the edge of the umbrella all around with a
warm flat-iron. Then another woman holds it up to
a window where there is a strong light, and hunts for
holes in it. If it is found to be perfect the cover is
neatly arranged about the stick, the tie wrapped
about it and fastened, and the finished umbrella goes
to market for a buyer.
</p>
<p>After the stick is mounted, how long, think you
does it take to make an umbrella?
</p>
<p>Well, my dears&mdash;it takes only fifteen minutes!
</p>
<p>So you see that in the making of so simple an
every-day article as an umbrella, that you carry on a
rainy day to school, a great many people are employed;
and to keep the world supplied with umbrellas
thousands and thousands of men and women are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
kept busy, and in this way they earn money to buy
bread and shoes and fire and frocks for the dear
little folks at home, who in turn may some day become
umbrella makers themselves.

have made an unpleasant exhibition of his unhappiness;
but he was a well-bred city boy, of which fact he
was somewhat proud, and so his impatience was vented
in snapping off the teeth of his pocket-combs, as he
sat by the window and looked out into the rain.
</p>
<p>It was the rain which caused his discontent. Only
the day before his father, going from New York to
Boston on business, had left Paul at his uncle&#8217;s, some
distance from the &#8220;Hub,&#8221; to await his return. It
being the lad&#8217;s first visit, Mr. Sanford had arranged
a very full programme for the next day, including a
trip in the woods, fishing, a picnic, and in fact quite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
enough to cover an ordinary week of leisure. Over
and over it had been discussed, the hours for each
feature apportioned, and through the night Paul had
lived the programme over in his half-waking dreams.

MASTER PAUL DID NOT FEEL HAPPY.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>And now that the eventful morning had come, it
brought a drizzling, disagreeable storm, so that Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
Sanford, as he met his nephew, was constrained to
admit that he did not know what they should find to
supply the place of the spoiled programme.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And my little nephew is so disappointed that he
has ruined his pretty comb, into the bargain,&#8221; said
the uncle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was&mdash;was trying to see what it was made of,&#8221;
Paul stammered, thrusting the handful of teeth into
his coat pocket. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how combs are made.
Could you make one, uncle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never made one,&#8221; Mr. Sanford replied, &#8220;but I
have seen very many made. There is a comb-shop
not more than a half-mile away, and it is quite a curiosity
to see how they make the great horns, rough
and ugly as they are, into all sorts of dainty combs
and knicknacks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of horns, uncle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Horns from all parts of the country, Paul. This
shop alone uses nearly a million horns a year, and
they come in car-loads from Canada, from the great
West, from Texas, from South America, and from the
cattle-yards about Boston and other Eastern cities.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean the horns of common cattle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Paul; all kinds of horns are used, though
some are much tougher and better than others. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
cattle raised in the Eastern, Middle and Western
States furnish the best horns, and there is the curious
difference that the horns of six cows are worth no
more than those of a single ox. Many millions of
horn combs are made every year in Massachusetts;
perhaps more than in all the rest of the country. If
you like we will go down after breakfast and have a
look at the comb-makers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Paul was pleased with the idea, though he would
much rather have passed the day as at first proposed.
He was not at all sorry that he had broken up his
comb, and even went so far as to cut up the back
with his knife, wondering all the while how the
smooth, flat, semi-transparent comb had been produced
from a rough, round, opaque horn.
</p>
<p>By and by a mail stage came rattling along,
without any passengers, and Mr. Sanford took his
nephew aboard. They stopped before a low, straggling
pile of buildings, located upon both sides of a
sluggish looking race-way which supplied the water
power, covered passage-ways connecting different
portions of the works.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Presently, just over this knoll,&#8221; said his uncle,
&#8220;you will see a big pile of horns, as they are unloaded
from the cars.&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
MY LADY&#8217;S TOILET.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></div>
<p>They moved around the knoll, and there lay a
monstrous pile of horns thrown indiscriminately together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really there are not so many as we should
think,&#8221; said Mr. Sanford, as Paul expressed his astonishment.
&#8220;That is only a small portion of the
stock of this shop. I will show you a good many
more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He led the way to a group of semi-detached
buildings in rear of the principal works, and there
Paul saw great bins of horns, the different sizes and
varieties carefully assorted, the total number so vast
that the immense pile in the open yard began to look
small in contrast.
</p>
<p>At one of the bins a boy was loading a wheelbarrow,
and when he pushed his load along a plank
track through one of the passage-ways Mr. Sanford
and his nephew followed. As the passage opened
into another building, the barrow was reversed and its
load deposited in a receptacle a few feet lower.
</p>
<p>In this room only a single man was employed, and
the peculiar character of his work at once attracted
the attention of Paul. In a small frame before him
was suspended a very savage-looking circular saw,
running at a high rate of speed. The operator caught
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
one of the great horns by its tip, gave it a turn through
the air before his eyes, seized it in both hands and
applied it to the saw. With a sharp hiss the keen
teeth severed the solid tip from the body of the horn,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
and another movement trimmed away the thin, imperfect
parts about the base. The latter fell into a
pile of refuse at the foot of the frame, the tip was
cast into a box with others; the horn, if large, was
divided into two or more sections, a longitudinal slit
sawn in one side, and the sections thrown into a
box.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
THE NEW CIRCLE COMB
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;This man,&#8221; said Mr. Sanford, &#8220;receives large
pay and many privileges, on account of the danger
and unpleasant nature of his task. He has worked
at this saw for about forty years, and in that time has
handled, according to his record, some twenty-five
millions of horns, or over two thousand for every
working day. He has scarcely a whole finger or
thumb upon either hand&mdash;many of them are entirely
gone; but most of these were lost during his apprenticeship.
The least carelessness was rewarded by
the loss of a finger, for the saw cannot be protected
with guards, as in lumber-cutting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Paul watched the skilful man with the closest interest,
shuddering to see how near his hands passed
and repassed to the merciless saw-teeth as he sent a
ceaseless shower of parts of horns rattling into their
respective boxes. Before he left the spot Paul took
a pencil and made an estimate.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, uncle,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to cut so many as that,
he must saw over three horns every minute for ten
hours a day. I wouldn&#8217;t think he could handle them
so fast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then, as he saw how rapidly one horn after another
was finished, he drew forth his little watch and found
that the rugged old sawyer finished a horn every ten
seconds with perfect ease.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to learn this trade?&#8221; the old
fellow asked. He held up his hands with the stumps
of fingers and thumbs outspread; but Paul only
laughed and followed his uncle.
</p>
<p>They watched a boy wheeling a barrow-load of the
horns as they came from the saw, and beheld them
placed in enormous revolving cylinders, through
which a stream of water was running, where they
remained until pretty thoroughly washed. Being removed
from these, they were plunged into boilers
ranged along one side of the building, filled with hot
water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here they are heated,&#8221; said Mr. Sanford, &#8220;to
clear them from any adhering matter that the cold
water does not remove, and partially softened, ready
for the next operation.&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
ANCIENT OR MODERN&mdash;WHICH?
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>From the hot water the horns were changed to a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
series of similar caldrons at the other side of the
room, filled with boiling oil. Paul noticed that when
the workmen lifted the horns from these vats their
appearance was greatly changed, being much less
opaque, and considerably plastic, opening readily at
the longitudinal cut made by the saw. As the horns
were taken from the oil they were flattened by unrolling,
and placed between strong iron clamps which
were firmly screwed together, and put upon long
tables in regular order.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I begin to see how it is done,&#8221; Paul said,
though he was thinking all the time of questions that
he would ask his uncle when there were no workmen
by to overhear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The oil softens the horn,&#8221; said Mr. Sanford, &#8220;and
by placing it in this firm pressure and allowing it to
remain till it becomes fixed, the whole structure is so
much changed that it never rolls again. Some combs,
you will notice, are of a whitish, opaque color, like
the natural horn, while others have a smooth appearance,
are of amber color, and almost transparent.
The former are pressed between cold irons and
placed in cold water, while the others are hot-pressed,
it being &#8216;cooked&#8217; in a few minutes. These plates
of horn may be colored; and there are a great many
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
&#8216;tortoise-shell&#8217; combs and other goods sold which are
only horn with a bit of color sprinkled upon it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The solid tips of the horns, and all the pieces that
are worth anything cut off in making the combs, are
made up into horn jewelry, chains, cigar-holders,
knife-handles, buttons, and toys of various kinds.
These trinkets are generally colored more or less,
and many a fashionable belle, I suppose, would be
surprised to know the amount of money paid for odd
bits of horn under higher sounding names. But the
horn is tough and serviceable, at any rate, and that
is more than can be said of many of the cheats
we meet with in life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next room, in contrast with all they had passed
through previously, was neat and had no repulsive
odors. Here the sheets of horn as they came from
the presses were first cut by delicate circular saws
into blanks of the exact size for the kind of combs
to be made, after which they were run through a
planer, which gave them the proper thickness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by &#8216;blanks&#8217;?&#8221; Paul asked,
as his uncle used the term.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can look in the dictionary to find its exact
meaning,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;But you will see
what it is in practice at this machine.&#8221;
</p>

<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>They stepped to another part of the room;
and here Paul saw the &#8220;blanks&#8221; placed in the
cutting-machine standing over a hot furnace, where,
after being softened by the heat, they were slowly
moved along, while a pair of thin chisels danced
up and down, cutting through the centre of the blank
at each stroke. When it had passed completely
through, an assistant took the perforated blank and
pulled it carefully apart, showing two combs, with
the teeth interlaced. After separation they were
again placed together to harden under pressure, when
the final operations consisted of bevelling the teeth
on wheels covered with sand-paper, rounding the
backs, rounding and pointing the teeth; after which
came the polishing, papering and putting in boxes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose they go all over the country,&#8221; said
Paul as he glanced into the shipping-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Much further than that,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;We
never know how far they go; for the wholesale
dealers, to whom the combs are shipped from the
manufactory, send them into all the odd corners of
the earth. Every little dealer must sell combs, and
in the very nature of the business they frequently
pass through a great many hands before reaching the
user, so at the last price is many times what the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
makers received for them. I suppose it often happens
that horns which have been sent thousands of
miles to work up are returned to the very regions
from which they came, in some other form, increased
very many fold in value by their long journey.
Or a horn may come from the remoter parts
of South America to be wrought here in Massachusetts,
and then be shipped from point to
point till it reaches some remote corner of Africa,
Spain, or Siberia, as an article of barter. And
even different parts of the same horn may be at the
same moment decking the person of a New York
dandy and unsnarling the tangled locks of a Russian
Tchuktch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While Paul was watching the deft fingers of
the girls who filled the boxes and affixed the
labels, his uncle stepped through a door communicating
with the office, and soon returned with
three elegant pocket-combs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One of these,&#8221; he said, &#8220;represents a horn which
came from <i>pampas</i> of Buenos Ayres; this one, in the
original, dashed over the boundless plains of Texas;
and here is another, toughened by the hot, short
summers and long, bitter winters of Canada. Take
them with you in memory of this cheerless rainy day.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>Paul could not help a little sigh as he thought
again of the pleasures he had enjoyed in anticipation;
but still he answered bravely, &#8220;Thank you; never
mind the rain, dear uncle. All the New York boys
go off in the woods when they get away from home;
but not many of them ever heard how combs are
made, and I don&#8217;t suppose a quarter of them even
know what they are made of. I can tell them a
thing or two when I get home.&#8221;

<h2>IN THE GAS-WORKS.</h2>
</div>

<p>Philip and Kitty were curled up together on the
lounge in the library, reading Aldrich&#8217;s &#8220;Story of
a Bad Boy.&#8221; It was fast growing dark in the corner
where they were, for the sun had gone down some
time before, but they were all absorbed in Tom
Bailey&#8217;s theatricals, and did not notice how heavy the
shadows were getting around them. Papa came in
by-and-by.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, little folks, you&#8217;ll spoil your eyes reading
here; I&#8217;d better light the gas for you,&#8221; and he took
out a match from the box on the mantle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;O, let me, please,&#8221; cried Philip, jumping up and
running to the burner. So he took the match, and
climbed up in a chair with it. Scr-a-tch! and the
new-lit jet gave a glorified glare that illuminated everything
in the room, from the Japanese vase on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
corner bracket to the pattern of the rug before the
open fire. But as Philip turned it off a little it grew
quieter, and finally settled down into a steady,
respectable flame. Philip always begged to light the
gas. It had not been long introduced in the little
town where he lived, and the children thought it a
very fine thing to have it brought into the house, and
secretly pitied the boys and girls whose fathers had
only kerosene lamps.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t you blow out gas, just as you do a
kerosene light?&#8221; asked Kitty, presently, leaving the
Bad Boy on the lounge, and watching the bright little
crescent under the glass shade.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; explained papa, &#8220;unless you shut it
off by turning the little screw in the pipe, the gas
will keep pouring out into the room all the time, and
if it isn&#8217;t disposed of by being burned up, it will mix
with the air and make it poisonous to breathe. A
man at the hotel here, a few nights ago, blew out the
gas because he did not know any better, and was
almost suffocated before he realized the trouble and
opened his window.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And where does the gas come from in the first
place?&#8221; pursued Kitty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, from the gas-works, of course,&#8221; said Philip
in a very superior way, for he was a year the elder of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
the two. &#8220;That brick building over by Miller&#8217;s Hill&mdash;don&#8217;t
you know&mdash;that we pass in going to Aunt
Hester&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that as well as you do, Philip Lawrence,&#8221;
said Kitty with some dignity. &#8220;What I wanted to
know was what it&#8217;s made out of. What is it, papa?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of coal,&#8221; said papa. &#8220;They put the coal in
ovens and heat it till the gas it contains is separated
from the other parts of the coal, and driven off by
itself. Then it is purified and made ready for use.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of coal? How funny! I wish I could see all
about it,&#8221; said Philip, looking more interested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so do I wish I could,&#8221; added Kitty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why it cannot be done,&#8221; said papa.
&#8220;If you really care to see it, and won&#8217;t mind a few
bad smells, I will ask Mr. Carter to-morrow morning,
when he can take you around and explain things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next day when Mr. Carter was asked about it,
he said, &#8220;O, come in any day you like. About three
in the afternoon would be a good time, because we
are always newly-filling the retorts then.&#8221; This
sounded very nice and imposing to the children, and
at three the next afternoon they started out with
papa. The gas-house certainly did smell very badly
as they drew near it, and dainty Kitty sniffed in considerable
disgust. Philip suggested that perhaps she
had better not go in after all; he didn&#8217;t believe girls
ever did go into such places. And upon that Kitty
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
valiantly declared she did not mind it a bit, and
sternly set her face straight.

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
A RETORT.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Carter met them at the door. &#8220;You are just
in time to see the retorts opened,&#8221; said he, and led
the way directly into a large and very dingy room,
along one side of which was built out a sort of huge
iron cupboard with several little iron doors. The
upper ones were closed tight, but some of the lower
ones were open a crack, and a very bright fire could
be seen inside. Everything around was dirty and
gloomy, and these gleams of fire from the little iron
doors made the place look weird and ghostly. Long
iron pipes reached from each of the upper doors up
to one very large horizontal pipe or cylinder near the
ceiling overhead. This cylinder ran the whole length
of the room, and, at its farther end, joined another
iron pipe which passed through the wall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are the furnace-doors down below,&#8221; said
Mr. Carter to the children. &#8220;What you see burning
inside of them is coke. Coke is what is left of the
coal after we have taken the gas and tar out of it.
The upper doors open into the retorts, or ovens, that
we fill every five hours with the coal from which we
want to get gas. Each retort holds about two hundred
pounds, and from that amount we get a thousand
cubic feet of gas.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is it just common coal;&#8221; asked Kitty, &#8220;like
what people burn in stoves?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly. It is a softer kind, containing more
of a substance called hydrogen than the sorts that
are generally used for fuel. Several different varieties
are used: &#8216;cherry,&#8217; &#8216;cannel,&#8217; &#8216;splint,&#8217; and so
on, and they come from mines in different parts of
England and Scotland, chiefly. Glasgow, Coventry
and Newcastle send us a great deal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Philip started as if a bright idea had struck him.
&#8220;Is that what people mean when you&#8217;re doing something
there&#8217;s no need of, and they say &#8216;you&#8217;re carrying
coals to Newcastle?&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You see such an enterprise would be
absurd. Just notice the man yonder with the long
iron rod! He is going to open one of the retorts,
take out the old coal&mdash;only it is now coke&mdash;and
put in a fresh supply.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A workman in a grimy, leather apron loosened one
of the retort doors, and held up a little torch. Immediately
a great sheet of flame burst out, and then
disappeared.
</p>
<p>He took the door quite off, and there was a long,
narrow oven with an arched top, containing a huge
bed of red-hot coals.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What a splendid place to pop corn!&#8221; exclaimed
Kitty.
</p>
<p>Papa laughed. &#8220;You would find it warm work,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;unless you&#8217;d a very long handle to your
corn-popper.&#8221; And Kitty thought so too, as she
went nearer the fiery furnace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Mr. Carter, &#8220;these red-hot coals
have been changed a great deal by the heat. They
have given up all their gas and tar, and are themselves
no longer coal, but <i>coke</i>. We shovel out this coke
and use it as fuel in the furnaces down below to help
heat up the next lot. Then new coal is put into the
retorts, and they are closed up with iron plates, like
that one lying ready on the ground.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all muddy &#8217;round the edge,&#8221; observed Kitty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that paste of clay is to make it air-tight.
The heat hardens the clay very quickly, so all the
little cracks around the edge are plastered up. When
the coal is shut up in the ovens, or retorts, the heat, as
I just told you, divides it up into the different substances
of which it is made; that is, into the coke
which you have seen, a black, sticky liquid called tar,
the illuminating gas, and more or less ammonia,
sulphur, and other things that must be got rid of.
Almost all these things are saved and used for one
purpose or another, though they may be of no use to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
us here. If we have more coke than we ourselves
need it is sold for fuel. The coal-tar goes for roofing
and making sidewalks, or sometimes (though you
wouldn&#8217;t think it possible, as you look at the sticky,
bad-smelling, black stuff) in the manufacture of the
most lovely dyes, like that which colored Miss Kitty&#8217;s
pink ribbon. The ammonia is used for medicine and
all sorts of scientific preparations, in bleaching cloth,
and in the printing of calicoes and cambrics.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When the materials of the coal are separated as
I told you in the retorts, most of the tar remains
behind, and is drawn off; but some gets up the pipes.
That large, horizontal cylinder is always nearly half
full of it. The gas, which is very light, you know,
rises through the upper pipes leading from the retorts,
and bubbles up through the tar in the bottom
of the cylinder. Then it passes along the farther end
of the cylinder, and into the condensing pipes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He opened a door, and they went through into the
next room. Here the large pipe which came through
the wall of the room they had just left, led to a
number of clusters of smaller pipes that were jointed
and doubled back and forth upon each other, cob-house
fashion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When the gas goes through these pipes,&#8221; said Mr.
Carter, &#8220;it gets pretty well cooled down, for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
pipes are kept cold by having so great an amount of
surface exposed to draughts of air around them.
And when the gas is cooled the impurities are cooled
too, so that many of them take a liquid form and can
be drawn off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next room they entered had a row of great,
square chests on each side, as they walked through.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the purifiers,&#8221; explained Mr. Carter
again. &#8220;They are boxes with a great many fan-like
shelves inside, projecting out in all directions, and
covered thickly with a paste made of lime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lime like what the masons used when they plastered
the new kitchen?&#8221; asked Philip.
</p>
<p>&#8220;About the same thing. The boxes are made air-tight,
and the gas enters the first box at one of the
lower corners. Then before it can get through the
connecting-pipe into the next box, it has to wind its
way around among these plates coated with lime.
This lime takes up the sulphur and other things that
we do not want in the gas, and so by the time it gets
through all the boxes it is quite pure and fit to use.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the party all went into the room where the
gas was measured. It was a little office with a queer
piece of furniture in it; something that looked like a
very large drum-shaped clock, with several different
dials or faces. This, Mr. Carter said, was the metre
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
or measurer, and by looking at the dials it could be
told exactly how much gas was being made every
day.

<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;As soon as the gas gets through the purifiers,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;it comes, by an iron pipe, in here, and is
made to pass through and give an account of itself
before any of it is used. And now I suppose you
would like to know how it does report its own amount,
wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_32' id='linki_32'></a>
<img src='images/illus-033.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
THE METRE.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Philip and Kitty both were sure they did want to
know, so he sketched a little plan of the metre on a
piece of paper, and then went on to explain it:
</p>
<p>&#8220;This shows how the
metre would look if you
could cut it through in the
middle. The large drum-shaped
box <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A. A.</span> is hollow,
and filled a little more
than half way up with
water. Inside it is a
smaller hollow drum, <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>B. B.</span>
so arranged as to turn
easily from right to left, on the horizontal axis C.
This axis is a hollow pipe by which the gas comes
from the purifiers to enter the several chambers of
the metre in turn, through small openings called
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
valves. The partitions <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>P. P. P. P.</span> divide the drum <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>B. B.</span>
into&mdash;let us say&mdash;four chambers, 1, 2, 3, 4, all of
the same size, and capable of holding a certain known
amount of air or gas. The chamber 1 is now filled
with gas, 3 with water, and 2 and 4 partly with gas
and partly with water. The valves in the pipe C are
so arranged that the gas will next pour into the chamber
2. This it does with such force as to completely
fill it, lifting it quite out of the water and into the
place that 1 had occupied before. Then as 1 is
driven over to the place which 4 had occupied, the
gas with which it was filled passes out by another
pipe and off to the large reservoir you will see by
and by, its place being filled with water. At the same
time 4 is driven around to the place of 3, and 3 to
that of 2. The water always keeps the same level,
and simply waits for the chambers to come round and
down to be filled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Next, 3, being in the place of 2, receives its
charge of gas from the entrance pipe, is in turn lifted
up into the central position, and sends all the other
chambers around one step further. And when the
drum gets completely around once, so that the chambers
stand in the same places as at first, you know
each chamber must have been once filled with gas
and then emptied of it. If then we know that each
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
chamber will hold, say two and a half cubic feet of
gas, we are sure that every time the drum has turned
fully around it has received and sent off four times
two and a half feet, or ten feet in all. Now we connect
the axis C with a train of wheel-work, something
like that in a clock, and this wheel-work moves the
pointers on the dials in front, so that as the gas in
passing in and out of the chambers turns the drum on
the axis, it turns the dial pointers also.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The right hand dial marks up to one hundred.
While its pointer is passing completely around once,
the pointer on the next dial (which marks up to one
thousand) is moving a short space and preserving the
record of that one hundred; and then the first
pointer begins over again. The two pointers act
together just like the minute and hour hands on a
clock. Then the next dial marks up to ten thousand,
and acts in turn like an hour-hand to the thousands&#8217;
dial as a minute-hand, and so on. You see each
dial has its denominations, &#8216;thousands,&#8217; &#8216;hundred
thousands,&#8217; or whatever it may be, printed plainly
below it. And now, when we want to read off the
dials, we begin at the left, taking in each case the last
number a pointer <i>has passed</i>, and read towards the
right, just as you have learned to do with any numbers
in your &#8216;Eaton&#8217;s Arithmetic.&#8217; There is one thing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
more to remember, however; the number you read
means not simply so many cubic feet of gas but so
many hundred cubic feet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Philip and Kitty immediately set to work to read
the dials on the office metre, and found that they
were not now so very mysterious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how do you know how much people use?&#8221;
asked Philip. &#8220;There is something like this metre,
only smaller, down cellar at home, and a man came
and looked at it the other day, to see how much gas
had been burned in the house he said, when I asked
him what he was going to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The metre you have at home works in the same
way as this,&#8221; said Mr. Carter, &#8220;and the dial-plates
are read in the same way. But the gas that your little
metre registers is only that which you take from the
main supply-pipe, to light your parlors and bed-rooms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When a stream of gas from the main enters the
house, it has to pass through the metre the very first
thing, before any of it is used; and each little metre
keeps as strict an account of what passes through
from the main to the burners, as the large one here
in the office does of that which passes from the purifiers
to the reservoir. But there is this difference
between the two: the gas keeps pouring through the
office metre as long as we keep making it in the retorts,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
but it passes through your metre at home only
just as long as you keep drawing it off at the burners.
So if we find by looking at the metre that 5450 feet
have passed through during a given time, we send in
our bill to your papa for that amount, knowing it
must have been burned in the house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But most likely the metre doesn&#8217;t say anything
directly about 5450. It says, perhaps, 11025. &#8216;How
can that be?&#8217; you would think. &#8216;We haven&#8217;t burned
so much as that,&#8217; and you haven&#8217;t&mdash;during this one
quarter. But after the metre had been inspected at
the end of the last quarter, the pointers did not go
back to the beginning of the dials and start anew;
they kept right on from the place where they were,
so that 11025 is the amount you paid for last time and
the amount you want to pay for this time, lumped
together. Now this is what we do. We turn to our
books and see how much you were charged with last
time, and subtracting that record from the present
record leaves the amount you have used since the last
time of payment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then suppose another case. Your metre registers
only as far as 100,000. At the end of the last quarter
it marked 97850; now it records but 3175. How
would you explain that, master Philip?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Philip looked puzzled a moment, and then said,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I should think it must have finished out the hundred
thousand and begun over again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. And to find the amount for this quarter
you would add together the remainder of the hundred
thousand (2150) and the 3175, and get 5325, the real
record. But I guess you&#8217;ve had arithmetic enough
for the present, so we&#8217;ll go out now and see the gasometer,
or gas reservoir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They all went out of doors then, papa, Mr. Carter,
Philip and Kitty, across a narrow court-yard. There
was a huge, round box, or drum, with sides as high
as those of the carriage-house at home, but with
no opening anywhere, &#8220;like a great giant&#8217;s bandbox,&#8221;
thought Kitty. Four stout posts, much taller
still than the &#8220;bandbox&#8221; itself, were set at equal
distances around it, and their extremities were joined
by stout beams which passed across over the top of
the gasometer.
</p>
<p>As the children went up nearer to it, they saw it
was made of great plates of iron firmly riveted together,
and that it did not rest on the ground, as they
had supposed, but in the middle of a circular tank of
water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After the gas has been made and purified and
measured,&#8221; said Mr. Carter, &#8220;it is brought by underground
pipes into this gasometer, and from here
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
drawn off by other pipes into the houses. The
weight of this iron shell bearing down upon the gas,
gives pressure or force enough to drive the gas anywhere
we wish.&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_33' id='linki_33'></a>
<img src='images/illus-034.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
THE GASOMETRE.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;But why do you put the&mdash;the iron thing in
water, instead of on the ground?&#8221; asked Kitty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So as to make it air-tight, and give it a chance to
move freely up and down. Of course if the iron
shell were empty its own weight would make it sink
directly to the bottom of the water-tank and stay
there. But gas, you know, is so much lighter than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
common air that it always makes a very strong effort
to rise higher and higher, carrying along whatever
encloses it. You saw that illustrated in the balloon
that went up last Fourth of July. Now, as the gas
from the works pours into the reservoir from beneath,
it is strong enough to lift the iron box up a little in
the water. Of course that gives a little more room.
Then as more gas comes in to take up this room, the
gasometer keeps on rising slowly. We make sure of
its not rising above the water and letting the gas leak
out, by means of the beams you see stretched across
above it. They are all ready to hold it down in a
safe position if the need should come.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the other hand, as the people in town draw off
the gas to burn, the gasometer would, of course, tend
to sink down gradually. So we have the water-tanks
made deep enough to allow for every possible necessity
in that direction. In very cold weather we keep
the water from freezing by passing a current of hot
steam into it. If it should ever freeze, the gasometer
might as well be on the ground, for it could not move
up and down, or be trusted to keep the gas from
leaking out around the edges. With these precautions,
however, we know it is perfectly trustworthy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw it one morning early, when I was out coasting
on the hill,&#8221; said Philip, &#8220;and it wasn&#8217;t more
than half as high as it is now.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A great deal had been drawn off during the night
and we had not been making any more during the
time to take its place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does it ever get burned out too much?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, there&#8217;s no danger of it. We make enough
to allow a good large margin above what we expect
will be used.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The children looked about a little longer, and then,
with good-byes and many thanks to Mr. Carter, walked
home again with papa, over the crisp, hard snow.
</p>
<p>Next week Philip had a composition to write at
school. He took &#8220;Gas&#8221; for his subject, and wrote:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Gas that you burn is made out of soft coal.
They put it in Ovens and cook it until it is not coal
any longer. The Ovens are so hot you cant go anywhare
near them but the men do With poles and big
lether aprons. I would not like to shovle in the coal.
I would rather have a Balloon. They use two or
three tons every day. it makes coke and Tar and the
gas that goes up the pipes. They make the gas clean
and mesure it in a big box of water, and tell how
much there is by looking at the clock faces in front.
Then it goes into a big round box made of iron and
then we burn it. but I do not like to smell of it.
you must not blow it out for if you do you will get
choked. This is all I Remember about gas.

<p>If it had been a yacht in which we were speeding
along at the rate of a trifle over a mile per minute,
we should have &#8220;taken our reckoning,&#8221; &#8220;hove the
log,&#8221; or done something nautical, and the captain
would doubtless have reported in regular sea-faring
terms that we were off Oil City with Lake Chautauqua
so and so many knots on our port quarter.

<p>But it wasn&#8217;t a yacht, nor a schooner, nor a Conestoga

we were travelling neck and neck with one of the
wildest looking storm clouds of hot mid-summer.

<p>No. It was&mdash;can you guess it? Yes, a <i>balloon</i>.
</p>
<p>And this is how it all came about:
</p>
<p>Fourth of July came upon the <i>fifth</i> that year, (because
of some strange oversight on the part of the
folks who first hit upon the plan of dividing time into

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
INFLATING THE &#8220;BUFFALO.&#8221;
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>At least it did in Cleveland; and although they
were a day late, the Clevelanders determined to have
a big time. So they had sent for Prof. Samuel A.
King, an aeronaut of distinction. Balloonists, you
know, are nearly always called &#8220;Professors&#8221;&mdash;why
this is so I don&#8217;t <i>profess</i> to know. And Prof. King
had arrived in Cleveland a few days before, bringing
his great balloon, the &#8220;Buffalo.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Early upon the morning of the 5th he was on hand
with the helpless monster all in a heap tied about
with ropes, mixed up with netting and sand-bags, and
supplemented with a big basket which looked a good
deal like an inverted straw hat made for some huge
giant.
</p>
<p>The netting was carefully spread out on the Nicholson
pavement in the centre of the pretty square
that you will remember if you have ever been in
Cleveland. The bags were filled from a wagon-load
of sand and hitched with snap-catches about the
edges. So they stood about in a circle. Then the
aerostat, as the great bag is called, was unrolled
and spread evenly over this. An oiled-muslin tube
was tied to the neck, and its other extreme to a gas
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
main in a hole which some of the workmen had dug
for the purpose.
</p>
<p>Next the gas was turned on. The bag began to
rise, looking at first like ever so many young whales
all huddled together. The men now began, under
the Professor&#8217;s direction, to pull the netting over to
hold the bag down. The sand-bags were brought
closer and set along on either side of the tube. The
bag now began to grow round and plump. Groups of
lookers-on kept growing, too, until all the square was
alive with them. The helpers kept walking around
the swelling globe, changing the bags to lower strands
of the netting; and so it continued until by two o&#8217;clock
the balloon was full&mdash;that is, allowance was made
only for expansion when the balloon should have
reached the clouds.
</p>
<p>Every few moments the breeze would sway the
monster to and fro, and it seemed chafing to break
away. Soon after, the basket was tied upon the ring,
and into this a great heap of sand-bags was piled,
and a lot of ropes, an anchor, an aneroid, thermometer,
compass and other accessories tied into the rigging
or outside of the basket.
</p>
<p>How grandly she stood there, the vast dome towering
above the trees, her amber sides bright with decorations
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
and her shapely globe held in leash by the
white network&mdash;but bless me! here&#8217;s more than four
pages used up, and we haven&#8217;t started yet.
</p>
<p>At precisely four o&#8217;clock the Professor&#8217;s cheery
voice was heard all through the square as he sang
out, &#8220;All aboard!&#8221; And his eight companions responded
as soon as they could get through the dense
crowd that surged on every side.
</p>
<p>Now the sole remaining rope which held us to the
earth was gripped by a score of eager men.
</p>
<p>The order came, &#8220;Let go!&#8221; The basket was
raised a few feet and then settled slowly back. This
made the crowd laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Throw out two bags!&#8221; cried the Professor.
</p>
<p>Then&mdash;then how grandly we lifted! How the cannon
roared and bands added their noise to the shouts
of the hundred thousand people whose faces were all
turned toward our little wicker car!
</p>
<p>The writer was sand-man, and following orders, he
let out the contents of another bag which fell in
a swift gray stream plump down into the midst of
a little group of young ladies who were seated on
a house-top.
</p>
<p>If it happens that <i>this book</i> reaches that family,
opportunity is now taken to apologize to those young
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
ladies for thus pouring sand down the backs of their
necks.
</p>
<p>Well, we sailed along grandly, soon leaving the
city far behind&mdash;I forgot to say that just as we
were leaving, a darkey in a white apron came through
the crowd bringing us a hamper of good things.
What an appetite this keen upper air gave us, to be
sure! We ate and drank and toasted everything and
everybody.
</p>
<p>Pretty soon one of the boys said, (we were all
newspaper men, and spoke of each other as &#8220;boys&#8221;):
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen a moment!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And we all held our breaths. What supreme silence!
the gentle sighing of the wind among the trees
a mile below, the barking of dogs, or subdued shouts
of excited villagers, was all we could hear&mdash;but hark!
</p>
<p>We were approaching a small town. In the square,
through the gathering twilight, we could discern a
crowd, and now there came to us, refined by distance,
the familiar notes, played by the village band, of &#8220;Up
in a balloon, boys!&#8221;
</p>
<p>We passed over the village, and the Professor
pulled the valve cord gently, so we dropped towards
the place and cheered in reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now let&#8217;s give them a song,&#8221; said the Professor.

<p>I wish the editor would only give me room to tell you
about the scores of funny things that happened that
afternoon; but after all, the real adventures happened
the next day. So I can only speak briefly of the
pretty carrier-pigeons we loosed, which flew swiftly
back to Cleveland, bearing our messages to the newspapers&mdash;short
notes only, to be sure, wrapped
about their slender legs, and which appeared in the
papers the following morning. One of these I find
in the scrap-book before me, for it was returned to me
some weeks afterwards. It reads:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<i>We&#8217;ve just eaten supper out of our hamper, unhampered by
any fears as to breakfast. Supper above the clouds is what I call
high living. We can see you yet, but you are only a smoky stain
upon the shore of Lake Erie. The Professor says we are to go
into camp and then continue trip to-morrow. Good-night.</i>&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<p>It would never do, either, to forget the plucky dog
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
which ran after our drag-rope as it trailed along the
ground when we were quite near the earth, and held
on with his teeth though we pulled him along over
the stubble on his back, and never let go until we
had jerked him plumb over a fence.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been in all sorts of camps&mdash;military camps,
hunting camps and camp meetings, but never dreamed
of such a thing as a <i>balloon camp</i> before! By the help
of some farmers we filled the great basket with stones
and then pitched a tent and made a fire at a safe distance.
Lines were run to trees in three directions,
loosely to give the balloon &#8220;play&#8221; in case of much
wind, and then we all lay down in our blankets and
tried to sleep.
</p>
<p>At the very first signs of dawn we were up, and
there she stood in the still air just like a vision. At
sunrise a hospitable farmer invited us to breakfast,
and wasn&#8217;t it good? I&#8217;ll never forget that coffee.
</p>
<p>By eight o&#8217;clock quite a large number of country
folks had reached the field. Teams were hitched all
along the fences. Now the Professor announced that
as he wished to make a long trip that day, he should
carry plenty of ballast and so could allow only two
persons with him. It had been agreed that we should
draw cuts, and this was done good-naturedly. The

<p>We were sorry indeed to leave our companions behind
us, but there was no help for it. So we took our
seats in the basket, said good-by, and were off.
</p>
<p>Now we went up! <i>up!</i> <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>UP!</span> passing through a thin
cloud that made everything below look dim and distant.
We were in the region where <i>November spends
the summer</i>. Whew! how chilly it was. We wrapped
our overcoats and blankets close about us and our
teeth chattered. Then we rubbed our hands and
faces. Why! how queerly they looked and felt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! ha! look at the Professor&#8217;s face. Why!
there <i>ain&#8217;t a wrinkle left</i>!&#8221; said the photographer.
</p>
<p>And so it proved. The aneroid told us that we
were over three miles from the ground, and the atmosphere
was so diminished in pressure that the
internal forces of the body pressed outward and made
the skin full and smooth.
</p>
<p>One of yesterday&#8217;s party had provided some large
envelopes with long red tails of tissue paper to drop
into towns, and we wrote messages and enclosed them
in some of these, putting sand in one end, and
launched them. We watched them as they shot
hither and yon in their swift flight toward the earth.
The chance finder was requested to send the contents
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
to the nearest telegraph office, but we never heard
from any of them, save one.
</p>
<p>About noon we found by comparing our maps with
the streams below that we had passed into Pennsylvania;
and not long afterwards we descried Oil City set
upon the creek, with all its hills covered with derricks
and oil tanks.
</p>
<p>Speaking of Oil City, reminds me of a rather funny
incident: For a couple of years I had been in correspondence
with a young man who resided there, and
who was also a journalist. His name and mine were
just the same. I had promised faithfully to stop and
see him at any time chance might bring me near his
home. I took one of the envelopes and wrote a <i>regret</i>,
dropping it over the city. It was picked up in
the road and handed to him, but he always insisted
that I had broken my promise unreasonably.
</p>
<p>At the rate in which Oil City was left behind we
knew our pace was very rapid, though to us it all
seemed like a dead calm, for we kept just even with
the wind.
</p>
<p>The Professor said we could reach New England by
midnight if the wind held and it didn&#8217;t grow cloudy;
but alas! for the past hour we had been watching a
little fleecy nebulous bit of mist that seemed, like a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
spirit, to spring from the nothingness of the blue ether,
growing constantly, and attracting other cloudlets
which came toward it from all quarters of the heavens
and were swallowed up. A growing, whirling wall of
pearly gray mounted and spread its shadow over half
the earth.
</p>
<p>We threw out sand and mounted above it. Then it
arose toward us again. It seemed as though we could
reach our hands into its surging depths. Over went
seats, baskets, the tent&mdash;everything we could spare,
and I&#8217;m not sure the Professor didn&#8217;t glare at one
of his companions with malicious and deadly intent.
</p>
<p>The truth rushed upon us that we were racing with
a storm.
</p>
<p>It was of vital importance to keep in the sun, for
the moment the shadows below could place their
chilly spell upon our steed, the gas would chill and
condense, and we would drop! drop! swiftly to the
earth. At last it came, and we knew it was inevitable.
Below us we could hear the crashing of
thunder reverberating away into the depths of the
black storm masses, and the lightnings every moment
lit the weird scene with a grandeur but few mortals
have ever witnessed. For a brief moment we hung
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
suspended like Mahomet&#8217;s coffin in the centre of a
great cave of pearl. Shall I ever forget that glimpse
of heavenly splendor? A single shaft of sunlight
broke through its walls and then died like the last ray
of hope. Then downward we rushed! A mile nearer
earth within the first minute! As the air grew denser
we fell more gradually. Our long drag-rope was out,
weighing perhaps three hundred pounds. Now we
were closely enshrouded by leaden clouds. The
rain ran down the bag in rivulets and trickled upon
our heads.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, oh look!&#8221; cried the Professor.
</p>
<p>We were now below the storm, and along its dense
ceiling could see its broad extent. We were above
the mountains. No towns nor even houses could be
discovered, only dense forests, through which the gale
howled as among the rigging of a ship upon a winter
sea.
</p>
<p>Very quickly our drag-rope touched the tree-tops
and began to glide among the swaying pines.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on at life-ropes!&#8221; shouted the Professor,
knife in hand.
</p>
<p>In another instant the basket gave a dreadful surge;
a mass of pine boughs swept about our heads, followed
by a strong jerk. The Professor had cut the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
cord which bound the anchor coil. The anchor had
dropped and caught among the limbs. We were
safe! No! not yet.

THE PROFESSOR&#8217;S DILEMMA.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The line must be shortened so we could clear the
tree-tops. All three
tugged at the rope.
Then other lashings
were made while the
great aerostat plunged
about like a wounded
leviathan. We were
eighty feet from the
ground. Two of us
found it convenient to
go down the drag-rope,
but the poor Professor,
tall and heavy, preferred
to try the tree. This
was wet and slippery, as
well as full of projecting
points of broken
branches. About twenty
feet from the ground
the Professor&#8217;s clothes caught. He was in a great
dilemma.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>Amid a good deal of laughter we managed to liberate
him, and as he reached the ground he exclaimed:
&#8220;Well, of all the scrapes I was ever in, this is about
the meanest!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But help came even here. Far down the slope we
heard a shout, which you may be sure was quickly
answered. Then, after a while, the bushes parted and
a half-score of woodsmen carrying gleaming axes ran
to our aid. They were all thoroughly wet, like ourselves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can we do for you?&#8221; they asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut down half a dozen of these pines. I want to
save the balloon,&#8221; answered the aeronaut.
</p>
<p>Then you should have seen the chips fly! Down
came the trees, one after the other, and finally the one
to which our steed was lashed. The gas soon escaped
through great holes torn by the limbs, and our
gallant craft was robbed of its power. Standing upon
one of the fallen trees I made the sketch you see before
you.
</p>
<p>We found upon inquiring that we had landed in
Potter county, Pennsylvania; and consulting our
watches, found we had travelled one hundred and
twenty-five miles in about two hours.
</p>
<p>We were made comfortable at a lumberman&#8217;s cabin,

<p>and managed to get out of the woods in a couple of
days where we could telegraph to our friends.
</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that after the excitement had
passed we felt very much like an old farmer who
listened to our adventures. He said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe some folks prefer to travel in a flying
Beelzebub, but I&#8217;m willin&#8217; to git along in a buck-board
with a good road to put my feet agin when I git
off.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>AUGUST&#8217;S &#8220;&#8217;SPERIMENT.&#8221;</h2>
</div>

<p>August <i>was</i> rather a troublesome boy. Generous
and jolly,&mdash;his playmates called him a
firstrate good fellow, but older people complained
that he was curious, meddlesome, and always &#8220;cluttering
round.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But here is mamma&#8217;s opinion:
</p>
<p>&#8220;August was born to be busy. He is inventive too.
He asks questions to gain information, and he handles
things to see how they are made.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is he tinkering at now, mamma?&#8221; asked
Tom. &#8220;He has got hold of an old, old book, full of
<i>f ss</i>, and all yellow; he&#8217;s rigged two pans in a barrel,
and bought a naptha lamp, and locked us all out of
the attic.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And he just came in with a covered basket,
mamma,&#8221; said Katie, &#8220;carrying it ever so carefully.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
I was jumping rope in the hall, and he asked me not
to joggle. What do you suppose he was doing,
mamma?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose we wait till he tells us,&#8221; said mamma,
smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s only trying some of his &#8217;speriments,&#8221; said
wise little Robbie, aged five.
</p>
<p>After the children went out, mamma took up her
work and sat down by the window, watching the three
outside, and waiting for her oldest boy, August, who
presently came to take her into his confidence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma, I am trying an experiment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And is that something new, August?&#8221; with an
encouraging smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the <i>kind</i> is new, mamma. Did you ever hear
of Réaumur?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who wrote that curious old book on the art of
hatching fowls by artificial incubation? Yes, August.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then will you come and see, mamma, what <i>I</i>
have begun to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He led the way, two steps at a time, to the attic.
When they reached the door, August drew from his
pocket a key, and unlocked it and led his mother in.
</p>
<p>A flour-barrel stood in the centre of the floor,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
closely covered. August removed the cover, and
lifted up a piece of carpet. His mother looked in.
</p>
<p>Within the barrel was
suspended a large, deep
pan, resting on three iron
cleats. This pan was partly
filled with hot water, and
floating on the water was
another pan&mdash;a shallow
one&mdash;which contained a
layer of sand an inch deep.
Over this was spread a
piece of linen cloth, and in
the cloth thirty-six large
Brahma eggs lay closely packed. In the center
stood a neat thermometer.

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;width:140px;'>
THE INCUBATOR.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;You have made your arrangements very neatly,
August,&#8221; said mamma. &#8220;Of course I do not understand
them exactly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see, mamma, this shallow pan gets its
heat from the water beneath it. I put that in hot, and
keep it just right with this lamp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Saying which, he knelt in front of the barrel, and
opened a neat little door, fitted with a brass knob and
hinges.
</p>
<p>Stooping down and looking in, his mother saw on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
a tall flower-pot, which stood upside down, a naptha
safety-lamp sending forth a small, steady flame.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That keeps the temperature about equable;&#8221; said
August, &#8220;but I have another lamp, larger than this,
to use in case my incubator grows too cool.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you set them?&#8221; asked mamma.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To-day is the first of March: then if no accident
happens, and the eggs are good, you expect them to
hatch on the twenty-first?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, mamma, and the eggs are all right because
I told Grandma I wanted some <i>very</i> fresh, and she
saved them for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Grandma know of your experiment?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! no, mamma. Not a soul but you knows
about it; and I want you to keep the secret until we
know how it will turn out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well!&#8221; said mamma; &#8220;but if you lock the
door you had better leave the key with me in case
anything should happen. I will look at your incubator
occasionally while you are at school.&#8221;
</p>
<p>August gave his mother a grateful look&mdash;he felt so
encouraged by her sympathy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How warm do you keep the eggs?&#8221; she asked as
he carefully replaced the carpet and cover.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Réaumur says at 32°, that is about 103 1-2 Fahrenheit.<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a><a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Must the eggs be kept at that temperature all the
time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, only through the first week. The second it
is a little less and the third still less.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is the luncheon-bell, dear; we must go down
or the children will be trooping up here. I hope, my
boy, that you will succeed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I don&#8217;t I shall try again,&#8221; said August. Then,
taking a final look to see that the thermometer and
lamp were all right, he locked the room and they
went down.
</p>
<p>He paid several visits to the attic during the day
and evening, finding on each occasion that all worked
well and steadily. Before going to bed he refilled the
lamp, so the supply of naptha shouldn&#8217;t be exhausted;
then he went to sleep and dreamed all night of eggs
and chickens.
</p>
<p>In the morning he was up and at his incubator before
any one else was stirring. The thermometer
indicated that the eggs were a trifle cool, so he turned
up the wick of the lamp. Before going to church he
turned the eggs. This he did twice daily, being careful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
not to jar them. The incubator worked well all
day and all night.
</p>
<p>The next day was Monday and he had his school
duties to attend to. He left everything in good order,
took the attic key to his mother, and went off to school
full of confidence.
</p>
<p>Alas! When mamma went up at ten o&#8217;clock, she
could scarcely see across the room. Everything was
black with soot. The naptha lamp was smoking
fiercely.
</p>
<p>The first thing was to get the window open, and
put out the lamp. Then mamma looked at the eggs.
Alas, again! There they lay covered with fine black
soot. She took up one and tried to wipe it, but succeeded
only in making a smirch which she could
not wipe off. She knew then that the eggs were
spoiled.
</p>
<p>In the midst of it all August came in from school
having been dismissed early. Poor August! He
could scarcely keep the tears back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, August,&#8221; said his mamma very practically,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think a naptha lamp just the thing. They
are very apt to smoke, and they are very inflammable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said August, trying to be cheerful. &#8220;Failure
the first! I shall try it again. Grandma will give
me some more eggs. I&#8217;ve only lost three days.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And <i>I</i> will go to town this afternoon,&#8221; said his
mother, &#8220;and see if I cannot find a lamp which will
be more reliable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no school that afternoon, so August
cleaned the room, and supplied the incubator with
fresh eggs, greatly encouraged by his mother&#8217;s sympathy
and interest.
</p>
<p>The other children were curious enough to know
what was going on in the attic; but they could get no
information.
</p>
<p>Toward evening Mrs. Grant returned from town,
bringing for her little boy a large tin lamp which
would burn kerosene. He lighted it and adjusted the
wick to just the right height. Then it was placed
within the barrel to warm the second setting of eggs.
</p>
<p>Day after day August and his mother watched and
tended them. Everything progressed finely.
</p>
<p>On the next Monday the eggs, having been in the
incubator a week, were far enough advanced to be
tested. At a south window there hung a heavy green
Holland curtain. In this mamma allowed August to
cut a hole, a little smaller than an egg, and she herself
staid to assist him.
</p>
<p>When all was ready, she handed August the eggs
one by one. One by one he held them to the aperture.
The first seemed quite transparent. In vain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
August turned and turned it&mdash;there was nothing to
be seen but the yolk floating at the top. With a sigh
he laid that aside and took up another.
</p>
<p>&#8220;O, mamma, look!&#8221; he cried excitedly.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Grant examined it with great interest. Not
only could she distinctly see the dark form of a little
chick, particularly the head with its immense eye, but
bright blood-veins were also plainly defined, branching
out in all directions from the body. Another and
still another of the eggs looked like this one. August
was greatly excited.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are lively enough!&#8221; he said. &#8220;See, mamma,
this one moves, and this!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then came one that was dark and shaky. &#8220;Addled,&#8221;
pronounced August. After this a number more appeared
as promising as the former ones.
</p>
<p>Finally all were tested. They were pleased enough
with the result. Three were clear&mdash;that meant there
were no chickens within the shells; one was addled;
and thirty-two contained live chicks.
</p>
<p>August was so wild over this discovery that his
hands grew unsteady, and he unfortunately dropped
two of the eggs and broke them. This left him but
thirty likely to hatch; but these were all very promising.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure we will succeed now, mamma,&#8221; cried
August gaily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like it, certainly,&#8221; said mamma.
</p>
<p>But alas for poor August&#8217;s bright hopes! and alas
for the expected chickens! Whether August was too
confident and grew careless, or whether it was one of
those unforeseen accidents that <i>will</i> happen, will never
be known; but this is certain, that the next morning
when August went, later than usual, to look at his incubator,
he found the thermometer had gone up to
110 and must have been at that temperature some
time, for in egg after egg, which he opened in despair,
was a poor little dead chick.
</p>
<p>Even if a boy is fourteen years old, he cannot help
crying sometimes over a great disappointment.
</p>
<p>Poor August put out his lamp with sorrowful breath
and some of his tears fell upon the hot chimney
which hissed as if in mockery.
</p>
<p>Then he locked himself in his own room, threw himself
on the bed, refused his breakfast and gave way
to his grief.
</p>
<p>Tom, Katie and Robbie all tried to get at him, but
without avail. Katie coaxed with loving words.
Robbie murmured, &#8220;Poor Gussie!&#8221; Tom said
&#8220;Never mind, old fellow, if your &#8217;speriment has failed.
Come and play ball.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>August&#8217;s reply was not very polite.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My experiment hasn&#8217;t failed, and that is all you
know about it, Tom!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the word &#8220;fail&#8221; seemed to rouse him, to restore
his courage; for presently unlocking the door and
coming out, he said quietly to himself, &#8220;I shall just
go down to Grandma&#8217;s for some more eggs&mdash;that&#8217;s
what I shall do!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Grandma was curious to know what he did with so
many eggs; but she asked no questions. She had
great respect for August and his &#8217;speriments.
</p>
<p>She only said, &#8220;This makes one hundred and eight
eggs, child. Now, if I had set all these, and if they
had all hatched, what a lot of little chickens I would
have had!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; thought August. &#8220;If!&mdash;&#8221; And he drew
a long sigh.
</p>
<p>Mamma, meanwhile, had been up to the attic to
look at the incubator, knowing nothing of what had
happened. Great was her amazement to find the lamp
out, a basin full of broken eggs and little dead chicks,
and the incubator itself deserted and empty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, August!&#8221; she cried, as she met him in the
door with a basket of fresh eggs. &#8220;What has happened,
dear child?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only failure number two;&#8221; he answered, trying to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
speak cheerfully, though even yet the tears lay high.
&#8220;They got too hot in the night, mamma.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet you are not quite discouraged?&#8221; said mamma.
</p>
<p>August held out his basket with a smile.
</p>
<p>So once more the incubator was set.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must take more pains this time,&#8221; said mamma.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; answered August, &#8220;I&#8217;ll try not to let any
thing happen to these.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Things did work more smoothly this time. The
temperature was kept about right, the eggs were tested
successfully and without accident.
</p>
<p>One week, two weeks, two weeks and a half, and
then things happened again, things which came near
being serious enough. It was Saturday afternoon.
August was going with the other children to a circus.
He had turned the eggs carefully and sprinkled them
lightly with warm water. He had admitted the children
into his secret, and they were all in the room
waiting for him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These eggs are a little cool,&#8221; said August, putting
one up to his cheek. &#8220;I must leave them just right,
I think I will fill the lamp and turn it up a little.
Tommy, will you take the lamp out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Down on his knees Tommy went, and drew out the
lamp which he set on the floor. Then, kneeling still
above it, he blew hard, directly down the chimney.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Puff!</span> BANG! <i>Crack!</i>&#8221; went something, causing
August, Katie and Robbie to start violently, while
poor Tommy, with his hands to his eyes, rolled over
on the floor with a groan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma, oh! mamma!&#8221; screamed Katie, &#8220;the
lamp is &#8217;sploded!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And Tommy&#8217;s killed!&#8221; shrieked Robbie.
</p>
<p>Mamma flew up the stairs and to Tommy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! his eyes!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Quick, August,
water!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! my poor Tommy!&#8221; sobbed little Robbie.
&#8220;See him all b&#8217;eedin&#8217;, b&#8217;eedin&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>August came running with the water, and knelt
down and held the basin while Katie flew for a sponge
and soft linen.
</p>
<p>When the blood was washed off, and his smarting
eyes had been bathed with fresh, cool water, Tommy
discovered that he had been more frightened than
hurt; and mamma and the rest were greatly relieved
to find his worst wound, a slight cut between the eyes,
could be cured by court-plaster.
</p>
<p>It was a great wonder, however, that more harm
had not been done; for when the child blew so forcibly
down the chimney, the wick shot up out of the
lamp and the chimney shivered in pieces; one of the
pieces had struck his face, making the cut, while the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
hot air and smoke flashing into his eyes caused them
to smart fiercely. August had neglected to fill the
lamp at the proper time, and the oil had burned nearly
out. It was the sudden forcing of air down the tube
which caused the explosion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you said &#8217;twas a safety lamp!&#8221; said
Katie indignantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t half so good as our un-safety ones;&#8221; declared
Robbie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s never safe to blow directly down upon a full
flame in any lamp,&#8221; said mamma. &#8220;The wick should
always be turned down first and the flame gently
blown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Accident the third;&#8221; said August ruefully. &#8220;Mamma,
do you feel like trusting me any farther?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His mother smiled. &#8220;The usual experience of inventors,
my son.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sunday passed quietly. Monday with its school
duties was well over. Tuesday morning&mdash;&#8220;Three
weeks to-day!&#8221; said August, and half fearfully opened
his incubator.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Peep! Peep! Peep!</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad trembled with excitement, and a flush of
joy spread over his face. He could hardly believe
his ears. &#8220;One, two, three,&#8221; he hurriedly counted,
&#8220;four, five, six.&#8221; On he counted, up to twenty eggs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
chipped or cracked. One chicken was half out of its
shell, and one, quite independent, was scrambling over
the rest of the eggs.
</p>
<p>August held his breath and looked at them as long
as he dared to keep the incubator open. Then softly
closing the lid, he rushed down stairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Hurrah!&#8221; he shouted at the door of his
mother&#8217;s room. &#8220;They&#8217;re hatching, mamma! They&#8217;re
hatching!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they, really?&#8221; asked mamma, pleased
enough, and she hurried up the stairs, closely followed
by the children, whom August&#8217;s joyful cry had
aroused from their sleep. In great excitement they
clustered around the barrel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! what a cunning, fluffy one!&#8221; cried little Katie,
as she spied the oldest chick.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is the matter with that other one?&#8221;
asked Tommy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has just left the shell and is not dry yet,&#8221; August
explained. &#8220;As soon as he is dry he will be downy
like the other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear em say &#8216;<i>peep! peep!</i>&#8217;&#8221; cried little Robbie,
grasping the edge of the barrel with both hands, and
stretching his short legs to their utmost extent in order
to get his eyes high enough to look over the edge.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What lots are cracked!&#8221; said Tommy. &#8220;Oh!
August, here is one cracked all round.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said August, &#8220;that chick will soon be out.&#8221;
Even as he spoke the shell parted, and a third little
bright-eyed chicken struggled out and looked about
in amazement.
</p>
<p>The children could have watched them much longer
with great interest, but mamma was afraid the incubator
would get too cool, and she advised August to
cover it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How <i>do</i> they do it, mamma?&#8221; asked Katie.

HOW THE CHICK-<br />
EN IS PACKED.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The little chick is packed very wonderfully in his
shell,&#8221; said mamma. &#8220;His head under his wing, legs
folded up with the feet toward the head, his bill coming
out from under one wing. This bill is furnished
with a little hard point on the top. When he is ready
to crack the shell and come out, he begins to move.
He turns his whole body slowly round, cracking the
shell as he goes, by pressing
with his whole force
against it, the hard, sharp
point on the top of his bill
coming next the shell.
When he is a few days old
this hard point drops off.
Just before he hatches, after the egg is cracked all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
around, he frees his head from his wing and struggles
to stretch himself. Then the shell parts and he gets
his head out, and presently his legs, one after the
other. I forgot to say that just before hatching he
gradually absorbs the yolk of the egg into his body,
and that nourishes him for twenty-four hours after
hatching.&#8221;

HOW THE SHELL<br />
IS CRACKED.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very curious, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Tommy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know anything but hens or ducks could
hatch eggs,&#8221; said Katie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Katie!&#8221; exclaimed August, &#8220;there is a
place at Canton, in China, where <i>thousands</i> of ducks&#8217;
eggs are hatched artificially every day. There are
twenty-eight rooms to the establishment, and all along
the sides of these rooms are rows of sliding trays
filled with eggs. These eggs are put in the first room
the first day; on the second day they are moved to
the second room; and so on, until they hatch in the
last room. The heat is graduated, the last rooms being
cooler than the first. All these eggs are hatched
by the heat of the rooms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If they hatch thousands every day,&#8221; asked Tommy,
&#8220;what do they do with the little ducks?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They hatch them for the people in the neighboring
towns,&#8221; replied August. &#8220;The Chinese are very
fond of ducks and ducks&#8217; eggs. A gentleman who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
has been to Canton, and seen the hatching-rooms,
told me he had seen people take eggs there to be
hatched. They would pay for the hatching and then
one of the men in charge of the rooms would count
their eggs, and give them just as many little ducklings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess they don&#8217;t have accidents there, then,&#8221;
said Katie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> won&#8217;t have accidents <i>always</i>,&#8221; August replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what <i>do</i> they do with so many ducks?&#8221; asked
Tommy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, half the poor Chinese people near the coast
live on the water all the time in boats that are half
houses. Of course they could not keep hens, but they
can keep ducks and they do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; cried Tommy. &#8220;I &#8217;member how papa
told about seeing them fed and called into the boats.
He said every flock knew its own call, and would go
scuttling through the water to the right boat. He
thought they were in this d&#8217;edful hurry, cause the last
one got whipped.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I do about school, mamma?&#8221; August
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! go, and recite your most important lessons,&#8221;
she answered wisely. &#8220;I will take care of the eggs
and chickens till you return.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>It was just as well for August to be occupied,
since the hatching, although it went on surely, was slow
work.
</p>
<p>With great faith in his incubator, August had previously
built a little yard for the expected chickens.
</p>
<p>It was in box form, about eight feet long and two
feet wide. In the center was a feeding-tray and water
tank, and at one end a hover. This hover (H) was
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
THE ARTIFICIAL MOTHER.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>lined with soft fur loosely tacked to the top and sides
and hanging down the front in narrow strips to form
a curtain. It sloped from the front to the back. The
water tank was a stout earthen bottle in a saucer; a
small hole near the bottom of the bottle let the water,
drop by drop, into the saucer, so that as the chickens
drank, the supply in the saucer was continually freshening.
The bottom of the yard was covered with
gravel three inches deep. This neat yard was now
waiting down stairs in a sunny shed room to receive
the chickens.
</p>
<p>August went to school, and on his way home called
for his grandmother to go up to the house to dinner.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>Grandma knew that it was just three weeks since
August had taken the last eggs, and that twenty-one
days was the time allotted by nature for the bringing
forth of chickens, so she shrewdly suspected what she
would find; but it had not occurred to her that she
would find chickens alive without the aid of a hen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandma,&#8221; asked August, as they walked along
&#8220;when you set a hen on thirteen eggs, how many do
you expect will hatch?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope for all,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;but I seldom get all.
I think ten out of thirteen is a very good proportion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My incubator beats your hens!&#8221; thought August.
</p>
<p>When they reached the house he took her straight
to the attic.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I never!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;So that is your
secret, August! Well, I declare! And it really
hatches the eggs, doesn&#8217;t it? I always knew, child,
that you would invent something wonderful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t <i>invent</i> much,&#8221; he said modestly. &#8220;In
1750, Réaumur, the French naturalist, gave an account
of his experiments in hatching eggs in barrels set in
hot-beds of horse-manure; and the Chinese and the
Egyptians have hatched them for ages in ovens.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But this is by hot water and lamps,&#8221; said Grandma.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said August, &#8220;I never saw an incubator before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
I made this; but, Grandma, I had read of them
made on the same principle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At any rate,&#8221; said Grandma, &#8220;I think that you
deserve great credit for patience and ingenuity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By evening thirty chickens were hatched from the
thirty-six eggs. The other six gave no signs of life.
By Grandma&#8217;s advice they were left in the incubator
&#8220;to give them a chance,&#8221; but they never hatched.
</p>
<p>The next morning all the members of the family
took the chickens down-stairs, even Robbie, who took
two in a basket, and deposited them in their new home.
</p>
<p>Then their food was prepared, the yolks of hard-boiled
eggs crumbled up fine, bread crumbs, milk,
and a little fine cracked corn. After a few days they
could be fed almost entirely upon the cracked corn.
</p>
<p>The whole family then stood around the yard admiring
the brood, thirty little, bright-eyed, yellow,
fluffy balls. They soon learned to eat and to drink,
and were busy, happy little creatures. They would
run under the hover when they wanted warmth or
quiet, just as naturally as they would have run under
a mother hen. The box was built on castors, and
could be rolled from window to window, and thus
kept in the sunlight, in which the little creatures reveled;
and at night it could be pushed near the stove.
Of course August had to renew the gravel very often,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
and he was very particular to keep the food dishes
sweet and clean. When the weather grew warm
enough the yard was rolled into an open shed, and
they could run out of doors.
</p>
<p>These chickens were considered very wonderful,
and many visitors came to see them. They grew
fast and were as tame as kittens. Day after day
the children came to feed the pretty pets, bringing
them young clover tops and tender grass. Katie
treated them with her birds&#8217; canary and hemp seed.
Robbie gave them bits of his cookies and cakes.
Anything that the children liked to eat, these little
chickens liked also; and when they heard the little
boots coming towards them they would perch on the
edge of their yard and chirp and peep and coax for
their dainties.
</p>
<p>By and by their wings began to grow and the fluffy
down was changed to feathers. Grandma said that
now they must have meat occasionally, chopped up
fine, and they had it Wednesdays and Saturdays.
</p>
<p>The little creatures were frantic for the meat. They
would fly upon August, and, if they could get there,
into the dish, which they more than once overturned.
</p>
<p>When their plumage was well out they were handsome
fowls. August built a large coop and out-door
yard for them, but they were not often confined in it,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
for the children loved to have them about with them,
and watched them as carefully as a hen mother could
have done; and great was the joy of Katie and Robbie
as they ran to their mother to report the first
crowing of the little cockerels.
</p>
<p>When last I saw them they were well grown. The
pullets, August proudly informed me, were laying.
</p>
<p>It was the glorious Fourth. Torpedoes were the
order of the day, and Katie and Robbie were amusing
themselves by throwing the snappers in all directions,
and seeing their feathered pets run to eat what they
could never find. The other fowls, disturbed by the
noise of the day, preferred to keep hidden away in
their houses, but these liked to keep about with the
children and see the fun.
</p>
<p>August began his experiments when some of my
young readers were quite little children. He has
continued them through several seasons, until now,
after much study and patient industry, he has enlarged
and greatly improved his incubator. He has changed
its form entirely, and has attached an electric apparatus
which regulates the heat, and avoids all danger
from smoke. He has applied for a patent, and has
made arrangements for taking care of a large number
of chickens as early as February, being still greatly
interested in this successful &#8220;&#8217;speriment.&#8221;

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
<h2>THE BIRDS OF WINTER.</h2>
</div>

<p>It seems strange that any birds should stay with us
during the cold and frost when there is so much
food which they like in the southern part of our
country. Men of science wonder why they do remain
here, and are unable to account for it. Perhaps
it is because it is the true home of these birds
which remain, and they prefer to search long and diligently
for their scanty food, and bear the cold and
the winds and the frost, rather than leave it. This is
as <i>we</i> should do, and doubtless the birds that stay
through the winter love <i>their</i> homes just as much&mdash;as a
bird possibly can.
</p>
<p>Of course everybody,&mdash;that is, everybody except
the tiniest, wee baby, has seen the winter birds, some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
of them; at least the Chickadees, the Snow-birds,
and Downy Woodpeckers, and Bluejays and Shore
larks. <i>But are you acquainted with the little fellows?</i>
Do you know where and how they live, and what
they eat, and of their habits and songs?
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_43' id='linki_43'></a>
<img src='images/illus-044.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
THE CHICKADEE.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>A great favorite of mine is the Chickadee, with his
black cap and white shirt bosom. This active little
gentleman is the most social and friendly of them all.
If out in the country, this little fellow in company
with his mates will twitter gaily at sight of you, every
now and then looking curiously at you as if asking,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
&#8220;And who are <i>you</i>, sir?&#8221; or &#8220;Who are <i>you</i>, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;
and pecking his way gradually nearer and nearer will
inspect you in the quaintest and merriest way.
Afraid! O no, not they. Mr. Samuels, a writer
about birds, says that he once had an inquisitive little
Chickadee perch on the end of his boot and sit
there watching him inquiringly. They have even
been known to feed from the open hand. If you will
daily scatter some crumbs for them before the door,
or upon the window-sill, you will learn for yourselves
how neighborly they are.
</p>
<p>Still the Chickadees are strangely tender, needing
a warm, cosy nest to shield their little bodies. They
cannot make their nests on the limbs of trees. Oh,
no, that wouldn&#8217;t do, for the first thing they knew the
wind would blow, blow, and down would come their
home. So they hunt around in the woods or along
the rails and posts, for the nests in the wood that
have been deserted by the woodpecker, who has flown
away to a milder clime. If the Chickadees can not
find these, they set to work themselves and with great
labor dig a hole in a tree, or post, for their winter quarters.
They prefer decayed trunks or posts so they
can work more easily. To the bottom of their holes
they bring pieces of wool, moss, and feathers or hair,
and weave warm carpets and curtains to make cosy
their little homes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>The Chickadees are very active, lively little things.
They are always in motion; now hopping along in
search of food, sending forth the peculiar cry that
gives them their name, and then alighting on the
tree limbs and moving from one tree to another
&#8220;traversing,&#8221; as Wilson, a great authority on birds,
says, &#8220;the woods in regular procession from tree to
tree, and in this manner traveling several miles a
day.&#8221; They are very strong for their size, and will
hang below a limb supported by their claws, with
their head downwards, which we should think would
make them dizzy, but it does not seem to.
</p>
<p>These little roamers of our roads and woods are so
genial, companionable and social, that not only do
<i>we</i> enjoy their society, but other birds are enchanted
with them and seek their company. The Chickadees
do not object. And so Brown Creepers, Nuthatches,
Downy Woodpeckers, and other birds, often join them
in their merry rambles and scrambles. They feed
mostly on very small insects and eggs, such as infest
the bark of trees, but will eat almost anything offered
them; even meat they will peck from a
bone.
</p>
<p>Pleasant, indeed, in the midst of winter is this little
bird&#8217;s cry:
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Chick-a-dee-dee-dee! Chick-a-dee-dee-dee!</i>&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>Pleasant his sharp whistle:
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Pe-wee! Pe-wee! Pe-wee!</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>How much we should miss these amiable favorites
should they ever take a notion to desert us! They
stay with us throughout the year, but in summer they
are shyer than in winter for they rear their young then.
It is not until their family cares are over in the autumn,
that they gather in small flocks and resume
their merry life and social ways.

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
THE BLACK SNOW-BIRD.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Another very interesting and neighborly winter
bird is our familiar Snow-bird, often called the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
&#8220;Black Snow-bird&#8221; to distinguish it from the Snow
Bunting or &#8220;White Snow-bird.&#8221;
</p>
<p>These tiny birds visit us from the north. Their
journeys extend over the whole breadth of the United
States. They appear here in the latter part of October,
and are first seen among the decaying leaves
near the borders of the woods, in flocks of about
thirty. If molested, they at once fly to the trees. As
the weather becomes colder they approach nearer the
farm-houses and towns.
</p>
<p>They are real weather prophets. When a storm is
near at hand they gather together in large flocks, and
work very, very diligently in search of food,&mdash;doubtless
making provision for the time of wind and storm
when they can get none.
</p>
<p>But it is after the snow-storms, when the ground is
white with the downy flakes, that the Snow-birds become
the most friendly. How pleasant it is then to
see them gather about the house, and around the barn
and out-houses, to search for edibles. Not only then
do they appear in the country-places, but even in the
crowded city their little forms may be seen in multitudes,
on the snowy streets and in the windows.
</p>
<p>They build their nests near the ground, often on a
stump or log, or in a deep thicket, in such a manner
as to be shielded from the wind and storms. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
construct their homes from bits of fine grasses and
leaves, and it is interesting to observe what wonderful
architects they are.
</p>
<p>The Snow-birds, I am sorry to say, though friendly
with us are not, like the little Chickadees, peaceful
among themselves. They are often very quarrelsome,
and will peck at each other in a way that little birds
should not. Perhaps they &#8220;make up&#8221; with one another
and are good friends again. I hope so.
</p>
<p>The Snow-birds are very nimble on the ground,
and, I guess, can eat faster and more for their size than
any other winter bird. It is a very funny sight to see
them scratch away the snow with their tiny feet to
get their food, which, when insects and eggs are not
to be had, is the seeds of many kinds of weeds that
still rise above the snow, and along the border of the
roads.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, perhaps, you have come upon a dead
Snow-bird in the morning following a cold night, and
perhaps have wondered if the poor little creature
froze to death, and why he did not die at home.
But the Snow-birds are sometimes affected with a
dizziness or faintness which makes them fall from the
limbs, or during their flight. <i>What</i> makes them
dizzy or faint, we do not know; not from hanging
head downwards like the little Chickadees, surely.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
But they often, alas! come to their death through
this affection.
</p>
<p>The snow-birds have a peculiar cry of &#8220;<i>Chuck!
chuck!</i>&#8221;&mdash;and another of &#8220;<i>Chit, chit-a-sit!</i>&#8221; which
however, they seldom utter except when taking flight.
They stay with us until about the 29th of April, when
they wing away to the north or to the higher ranges
of our mountains.
</p>
<p>Somewhat similar to the Snow-birds are the Snow
Buntings or &#8220;White Snow-birds.&#8221; They appear every
winter in large flocks, often of many thousands.
They are sometimes called &#8220;bad weather birds,&#8221; from
the fact of their moving to the northward during fine
weather and to the southward on the advent of deep
snow-storms. They are much shyer than either the
Chickadees or Snow-birds; but they are often seen
on the roadsides and in the lanes searching for the
seeds of weeds that grow there. On the sea-shore,
which they greatly frequent, they live on small shellfish.
It is curious that the greater the snow and the
colder the weather of winter, the whiter do the Snow-Buntings
appear.
</p>
<p>They are very swift flyers, and often in flocks of
great numbers seem to be a cloud of snow-flakes
driven before a storm. They make their nests in the
fissures of the rocks, forming from grass, and feathers,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
and the down of the Arctic fox, a very cosey home.
They frequent the roads and lanes in the vicinity of
Boston, and their white forms and busy beaks can be
seen throughout the winter season.

THE SNOW BUNTING.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>They have peculiar notes like a clear whistle, and
a &#8220;<i>chirr, chirr!</i>&#8221; which they utter when flying.
</p>
<p>A very fine little bird quite common in this State
in the winter season, is the Brown Creeper, with its
showy brown and white coat. These active little
creatures are great lovers of the woods and pass
their lives among the trees.
</p>
<p>Unlike the Chickadees and Nuthatches, who also
are partial to the woods, they very rarely descend to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
the ground to either hop about or hunt for food.
Nor do they, like the two former birds, ever hang to
a limb with their heads downward.
</p>
<p>Still the Brown Creeper seems to be constantly in
activity, and hunts most diligently for the insects it
feeds upon. This it does somewhat in the manner
of the Woodpecker, by clinging to the trunks or
branches of trees, supporting itself by its stiff tail-feathers
and thus moving about quite securely.
</p>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
THE BROWN CREEPER.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>They are very methodical. They strive to get
every insect from a tree that there is on it, before
leaving for another. So they generally alight near
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
the foot of a tree and gradually climb to the top; an
insect must be very, very small to escape their piercing
gaze.
</p>
<p>They often work around a tree in spirals, and so
are at times lost to the sight of an observer of their
ways; and if the watcher runs around to the other
side of the tree, very likely by the time he gets there,
lo! they are back to the former side.
</p>
<p>But they are not at all shy, and though not as
neighborly and social as the Chickadee, or Snow-bird,
still they will not fly away from the presence of unmolesting
persons.
</p>
<p>The Brown Creeper has not the bill suitable to excavate
a hole for himself, so he is obliged to find a
hollow trunk, a squirrel&#8217;s nest, or a deserted Woodpecker&#8217;s
home. Here the little bird builds a nest of
dry twigs and lays its pretty eggs.
</p>
<p>As the mid-winter cold deepens they retire to the
depths of the woods, or into the brown and sheltered
thickets, where their little cry of &#8220;<i>Chip, chip</i>,&#8221; and
&#8220;<i>Cree, cree, cree</i>,&#8221; may be frequently heard; and very
pleasant it is, too. Very useful they are, these little
Brown Creepers, as well as the Chickadees and Nuthatches,
for they help preserve our beautiful trees and
shrubbery from the destroying worms and insects.
</p>
<p>I have mentioned the Nuthatches. These birds,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
a little larger than the others before noticed, are not
so numerous as the Chickadees and Snow-birds, but
they are very interesting. The name of Nuthatches
was given to them long ago, because it was supposed
they broke the wood nuts by repeated <i>hatchings</i> or
hammerings with their bills. But now men of science,
who study birds, do not think that is true, and believe
the Nuthatches to be wrongly named.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
NUTHATCHES.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>It was also thought that the Nuthatches, like the
squirrels, lay up in the summer a store of nuts for
their winter use. But this also is doubted, since the
Nuthatch will climb along the trees and limbs in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
search of insects and larvæ when the tree hangs full
of nuts. So it is thought their principal food is composed
of ants, seeds of various shrubbery, bugs and
insects.
</p>
<p>While the female bird is sitting on her eggs, the
male Nuthatch displays a great deal of care and affection,
supplying her regularly with the choicest food
he can collect. With this he flies away to the mouth
of the hole where they have established their home,
and calls to her so tenderly, offering her the delicacy
he has brought. He seems to call to her sometimes,
simply to inquire how she is, and to soothe her labors
with his incessant chatter. Seldom does he
venture far from the nest, and if any danger threatens
he instantly flies back to alarm her.
</p>
<p>The white-breasted Nuthatch is known by his cry
of &#8220;<i>quank, quank</i>,&#8221; repeated frequently as he keeps
moving along the branches of a tree, piercing the
bark with his bill and breaking off pieces in search of
insects and their larvæ.
</p>
<p>This affectionate bird, like the little Chickadees,
rests and roosts with his head downwards; and also
like them, is very curious and inquiring. If you are
in sight, he will gradually make his way to you and
reconnoitre your appearance, as if he would learn who
you are.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>There is also another bird of this species called the
red-breasted Nuthatch, who is seen in New England,
in winter, and who leads a similar life to his white-breasted
relative.

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
THE DOWNY WOODPECKER.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Though most of the many species of Woodpeckers
leave us on the advent of cold weather, still there are
some that remain. My little readers, I am certain,
have nearly all seen the round homes of the Woodpecker.
You may observe them in almost any wood.
They are about alike except in size and situation. A
round hole in a tree or post is all you will see from a
distance; but if you can climb,&mdash;for their holes are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
usually more than six feet from the ground,&mdash;you
may look down into the deep home itself.
</p>
<p>How much patience and perseverance they must
have to dig, bit by bit, such straight deep nests.
These holes are seldom lined with any thing, but are
generally enlarged at the bottom so as to give the
family more &#8220;elbow room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The one we know best in winter is the Downy
Woodpecker, the prettiest and smallest of the tribe.
It builds its nest in various trees, preferring the apple-tree,
poplar and birches. Its hole is smaller than
those of other woodpeckers because, I suppose, the
bird itself is so much smaller that he can do with
less room.
</p>
<p>The Downy Woodpeckers are very sociable; and
although they themselves are not gregarious, you may
often see them followed by Chickadees, Creepers,
Nuthatches and Wrens, whose company they appear
to be pleased with.
</p>
<p>They are not shy of man, but, unlike most of their
tribe, haunt roadsides, orchards, and grounds about
houses and out-buildings, which they prefer to the
deep forests. They are generally seen in pairs, and
are very active little birdies. In searching for food,
insects and eggs, they move from tree to tree and thus
pass the day. They rarely alight on the ground. Their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
ordinary cry is a &#8220;<i>Chick</i>, <i>chick</i>,&#8221; repeated rapidly.
</p>
<p>A somewhat larger Woodpecker, called the Hairy
Woodpecker, is also an inhabitant of our woods in
winter and much like the Downy Woodpecker in habits.
</p>
<p>These are the principal and most common of our
winter birds. There are some others sometimes seen,
such as the Tree-Sparrow, Blue-Jay and Golden
Crowned Wren, but space forbids an account of
their ways and songs. I hope what I have told you
of the winter birds will induce you to study and observe
more closely their almost human ways.

<h2>SOMETHING ABOUT LIGHT-HOUSES.</h2>
</div>

<p>You have all heard of the Seven Wonders of
the World; did you know that two of these
wonders were veritable Light-houses?
</p>
<p>About 300 B. C., Cheres, the disciple of Lysippus,
cast the famous brazen Colossus of Rhodes, a statue
of the Sun God Apollo, and erected it at the entrance
of the harbor where it was used as a Light-house, the
flames which crowned the head of the Sun God by
night serving to guide wandering barks into his Rhodian
waters.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
FOURTH ORDER LIGHT-HOUSE, AT PENFIELD REEF, L. I. SOUND.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>For eighty years its hundred brazen feet towered
superbly above port and town, and then it was partly
destroyed by an earthquake. For nearly a thousand
years the sacred image remained unmolested where it
had fallen, by Greek and Roman, Pagan and Christian;
but at last the Saracen owners of Rhodes, caring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
as little for its religious association as for its classic
antiquity, sold the brass of it for the great sum of
£36.000, to the Jewish merchants of Edessa.
</p>
<p>Just about the time that the Colossus was set
astride the Rhodian harbor, King Ptolemy Philadelphus
caused a noble tower of superb white stone, four
hundred feet high, to be erected by an architect
named Sostrasius, son of Dixiphanes, at the entrance
to the port of Alexandria, which was a bran-new busy
city in those days, a mere mushroom growth in that
old, old Egypt, where the upstart Ptolomies were
reigning on the throne of the Pharaohs.
</p>
<p>It is said that this Sostrasius didn&#8217;t want his own
name to be forgotten, so he carved it deep in the
stone of the tower and covered it over with plaster
whereon he inscribed by royal command:
</p>
<p>&#8220;King Ptolemy to the Gods, the Saviours, for the
benefit of sailors.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Josephus tells us that the light, kept burning on the
top of this Pharos, as it was called, probably from a
word that signifies <i>fire</i>, was visible for forty miles at
sea. For a thousand years it shone constantly until
the Alexandrian Wonder likewise fell a prey to time
and the Saracens.
</p>
<p>The words Pharos-Phâre, Faro, etc., have been
adopted into more than one European language to
express Light-house or sea-light.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>Some persons suppose that great mirrors must have
been used to direct the light on the Pharos and keep
it from being lost, but it is most probable that no
more effective means of illumination than a common
fire was employed.
</p>
<p>The only other Light-houses of antiquity of which
any record has been preserved are the Tower of
Conira in Spain, which Humboldt mentions as the
<i>Iron Tower</i>, and a magnificent stone Light-house at
Capio, near the mouth of the Guadalquiver, that
Strabo tells us about, on a rock nearly surrounded
by sea.
</p>
<p>Then tradition points out Cesar&#8217;s Altar at Dover, the
<i>Tour d&#8217; Ordre</i> at Boulogne, a Roman Pharos at Norfolk,
and, in early British history, St. Edmund&#8217;s Chapel
at the same place, as having been originally intended
for sea-lights.
</p>
<p>Though we are far ahead of our forefathers in our
scientific apparatus for illuminating Light-houses, we
have never equalled them in magnificence of architecture;
for, in point of grandeur, the <i>Tour de Corduan</i>
at the mouth of the River Garonne, in France, is
probably the noblest edifice of the kind in the world,
and it is nearly three hundred years since it was completed
under Henry IV., having been twenty-six years
in building.

A MODERN LIGHT-HOUSE
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>All these centuries it has stood strong on its great
reef, and has served to guide the shipping of Bordeau
and the Languedoc Canal, and all that part of
the Bay of Biscay; and it promises, in all human probability,
to show its steadfast light for centuries to
come.
</p>
<p>Corduan is stoutly built in four stories, each of
a different order of architecture, highly ornamented
and adorned with the busts of the Kings of France,
and of the heathen divinities. The first story contains
the store-rooms, the second, the so-called King&#8217;s
apartments, the third a chapel, and the fourth the
dome or lower lantern. The tower completed is 197 feet
high.
</p>
<p>When this splendid structure was completed no
better method for illuminating was known than by
burning billets of oak wood in a chauffer in the upper
lantern; and it was considered a great matter when a
rude reflector in the form of an inverted cone was
suspended above the flame to prevent the light from
escaping upward. It is not known, in fact, that any
more effective mode of lighting was employed until
1760, not much more than one hundred years ago; and
then the radiance was not especially brilliant as it
would seem to us. At that time Smeaton the engineer
began to use wax candles at the Eddystone Light-house,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
which soon degenerated to tallow dips, probably
on account of the expense, and they must have
given the keeper abundance of occupation in the way
of snuffing and replenishing.
</p>
<p>In 1789 a French scientist, M. Lenoir, made an
epoch in the history of Light-houses, and in the progress
of civilization as well, when he introduced an
improvement in the way of lighting up the <i>Tour de
Corduan</i>; for, of course, the comparative safety in
coast navigation attained to by means of our modern
Light-house system is of the first consequence in commerce
and international communication, which means
the spread of science, enlightenment and religion
throughout the world. M. Lenoir placed Argand
lamps with parabolic mirrors or reflectors in the lantern,
which is, as it appears, a glass room on the summit
of the tower entered by a trap-door at the head of
a spiral staircase. Such a great change having been
brought about, men of science have not rested content,
but have gone on making one advance after
another. In 1820 the famous diaptric instruments of
Mr. Fresnel were placed in Corduan on trial, and
proved such a grand success that, gradually, they have
been universally adopted. The wonderful lens which
you saw at the Centennial belongs to a diaptric refracting
light of the first order, and oil lamps
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
constructed on the Fresnel principle, and, placed with
lenses of different orders, according to the Light-house
they are used for, serve an admirable purpose. Lard
is found to be the best illuminator, as a general
thing, for the light it casts through lenses of the first
order reaches as far out to sea as it is possible for
any light to be seen on account of the convexity of
the earth. Experiment has proved it safer than mineral
oil, and it is cheaper than gas, which however is
occasionally used near a city whence it can easily be
obtained. Only in some few special instances
electric light, the most intense procurable, is employed.

LIGHT-HOUSE ON MT. DESERT, COAST OF MAINE.

</p>
</div>

<p>The Centennial birth-day gift of the citizens of
France to the American Republic is a colossal brazen
statue of Liberty, which is to be a Pharos to light the
shipping of the world into New York harbor. It will
stand on Bedloe&#8217;s Island, and from the torch in its
uplifted hand will flash a calcium light. Only the
hand and arm were finished in time to be sent to the
Exposition; but these were on so gigantic a scale that
a man standing in the little gallery which ringed the
thumb holding the torch seemed like an ant or a fly
creeping along at that height.
</p>
<p>Sir Walter Scott&mdash;dear Sir Walter, whose &#8220;Tales
of a Grandfather&#8221; and Scottish stories and poems
were so delightfully familiar to the boys and girls of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
the last generation, left a charming little diary of a
voyage he made in the summer of 1814, on board a
Light-house yacht, in company with the Commissioners
of Northern Lights,&mdash;who have charge of the Light-houses
in Scotland, as the Elder Brethren of Trinity
House have of those in England,&mdash;their Surveyor-Viceroy,
the engineer Stevenson, and a few other
gentlemen.
</p>
<p>The first Light-house they visited was an old tower,
like a &#8220;border keep,&#8221; still illuminated by a grate fire
on top. The commissioners think of substituting an
oil revolving-light; but Sir Walter wonders if the <i>grate</i>
couldn&#8217;t be made to revolve!
</p>
<p>Next they came to Bell Rock, which, in olden
times, was the terror of sailors feeling their way in
and out of the islands and rocks and shoals of the
beautiful, perilous coast of Scotland. Inch-cape
Rock, as it was then called, had shipwrecked many a
helpless crew before the Abbot of Aberbrathock, fifteen
miles off, out of pity caused a float to be fixed
on the rock, with a bell attached which, swinging by
the motion of the waves, warned seamen of the
danger.
</p>
<p>Many years later, when Abbot and Monastery
bells had all become things of the past, a humane
naval officer set up two beacons on Bell Rock by subscription;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
but they were soon destroyed by the fury
of the elements.
</p>
<p>At last in 1802, people began to realize the danger
of this terrible reef in the highway of navigation, and
the Commissioners appointed Mr. Robert Stevenson
to erect a Light-house on this point.
</p>
<p>It was a perilous undertaking, and once the engineer
and his workmen made a very narrow escape
from drowning; but it was successfully accomplished
by the brave and skilful Stevenson. Sir Walter thus
describes this famous beacon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Its dimensions are well known; but no description
can give the idea of this slight, solitary, round
tower, trembling amid the billows, and fifteen miles
from Arbraeth (Aberbrathock), the nearest shore.
The fitting up within is not only handsome, but elegant.
All work of wood (almost) is wainscot; all
hammer-work brass; in short, exquisitely fitted up.
You enter by a ladder of rope, with wooden steps,
about thirty feet from the bottom where the mason-work
ceases to be solid, and admits of round apartments.
The lowest is a storehouse for the people&#8217;s
provisions, water, etc.; above that, a storehouse for the
lights, oil, etc.; then the kitchen of the people, three
in number; then their sleeping chamber; then the
saloon or parlor, a neat little room; above all the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
Light-house; all communicating by oaken ladders
with brass rails, most handsomely and conveniently
executed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the course of the voyage Mr. Stevenson determined
that his &#8220;constituents&#8221; should visit a reef of
rocks called <i>Skerry Vhor</i> (Skerrymore), where he
thought it would be essential to have a Light-house.
Sir Walter&#8217;s description of this visit is quite amusing
and perhaps you would like to read it. The wind had
blown squally all night, and in consequence everything
and everybody were pitched and tossed about at a
great rate, on board the little vessel. Nobody relished
the attempt to land under these circumstances on this
wild ridge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quiet perseverance on the part of Mr. Stevenson,
and great kicking, bouncing, and squabbling upon that
of the Yacht, which seems to like the idea of Skerry
Vhor as little as the Commissioners. At length, by
dint of exertion, comes in sight this long ridge of
rocks (chiefly under water) on which the tide breaks
in a most tremendous style. There appear a few low,
broad rocks at one end of the reef, which is about a
mile in length. These are never entirely under water
though the surf dashes over them. Pull through a
very heavy swell with great difficulty, and approach
a tremendous surf dashing over black pointed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
rocks&mdash;contrive to land well wetted. We took possession of
the rock in the name of the Commissioners, and generously
bestowed our own great names on its crags and
creeks. The rock was carefully measured by Mr. S.
It will be a most desolate position for a Light-house&mdash;the
Bell Rock and Eddystone a joke to it, for the
nearest land is the wild island of Tyree, at fourteen
miles distance. So much for the Skerry Vhor.&#8221;

</p>
</div>

<p>As might have been expected, the Commissioners
were discouraged at the aspect of affairs and delayed
the work from year to year, but at last, in 1834, the
Board placed this serious undertaking in the hands of
Mr. Alan Stevenson.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stevenson has left us a thrilling account of his
noble work on Skerrymore Rocks, than which no
worthier monument was ever left behind to the memory
of a gifted and conscientious man.
</p>
<p>In the first place he had to build barracks for his
workmen on the Isles of Tyree and Mull, and then
to begin the foundation of the tower on the only one
of the gneiss rocks of the reef which was broad
enough for the purpose, and this is but barely so, for
at high water little remains around the tower&#8217;s base
but a narrow band of a few feet of rugged rocks,
washed into gullies by the sea, which plays through
them almost incessantly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>Everything had to be thought of and provided for
beforehand; even so small a matter as the want of a
little clay for tamping holes might have stopped the
work for a time.
</p>
<p>Piers were built at Mull where the granite was
quarried, and all sorts of conveniences and contrivances
for the vessels and tug in use.
</p>
<p>The poor workmen suffered dreadfully from seasickness
when compelled to live on their vessel, so
they erected a temporary wooden barrack on the rock,
but it was completely swept away in a November gale,
destroying the work of a season in a single night.
The dauntless men went to work again, however, and
built another shelter which stood so successfully that
it was finally taken down several years after the Light-house
was completed.
</p>
<p>Alan Stevenson tells us of their life in this wave-washed
eyrie, where he was perched forty feet above
the sea-beaten rock with a goodly company of thirty
men, where often for many a weary night and day
they were kept prisoners by the weather, anxiously
looking for supplies from the shore. At such times
they were generally obliged to stay in bed, where
alone they found an effectual shelter from the wind
and spray which searched every cranny in their walls.
More than once the fearfulness of the storm drove the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
more timid from their frail abode, which the sea
threatened to overwhelm, out on the bare rock where
the roofless wall of the Light-house offered a safer
defence against the perils of the wind and waves.
</p>
<p>Innumerable were the delays and disappointments
which tried the courage and faith of Stevenson and
his brave band. It was a good lesson in the school
of patience, and they learned to trust in something
stronger than an arm of flesh. More than once their
cranes and materials were swept away by the waves,
and the workmen left, desponding and idle. They
incurred daily risks in landing and in blasting the
splintery gneiss, and in the falling of heavy bodies
in the narrow space to which they were confined. For
all, they met with no loss of life or limb, and maintained
good health in spite of being obliged to live on
salt provisions for six summers.
</p>
<p>But the hardships and responsibilities by no means
end with the building of the Light-house; the keeper
who has it in charge holds a most important position,
for upon the skill of his hands in the management
of the delicate costly lenses and machinery, the clearness
of his head, and the courage of his heart, as well
as his honesty and fidelity, depends, even more than
upon the captain of a vessel, the safety of many
precious lives and millions of property; so it is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
of the first importance that he be intelligent, efficient
and trustworthy.
</p>
<p>A Light which has been visible for years cannot be
suffered to be extinct for one hour without endangering
a vessel&#8217;s safety. The failure to illuminate at the
proper time might prove fatal to the confiding mariner.
</p>
<p>In England it is a situation for life unless the
holder prove unworthy, with a pension if superannuated;
but in our own country the appointments are in a
measure political, and consequently liable to be temporary.
This circumstance is deplored by the Board
which sometimes in this way loses valuable servants
after they have gained a skill and experience which
only comes with time; and raw, untried hands have
to be placed in positions of trust. It is hoped that
some change will soon be brought about in this
matter.

FIRST CLASS LIGHT-SHIP, WITH STEAM FOG WHISTLE.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>A year or more ago a gentleman, who holds an important
position in the office of the Light-house Board
and is specially interested in the comfort and welfare
of the keepers, came in the course of a tour he was
making on one of the Supply Ships, which carry half-yearly
stores to the different posts, to a very isolated
Light-house off the Florida coast, twenty miles from
any human habitation and sixteen from <i>terra firma</i>.
Just before the arrival of the vessel a little child of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
the keeper had died, and was about to be buried in
the sea without so much as a word of prayer being
said over it. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; was shocked to find that these
poor people in their isolation seemed to have no idea
of religion, and that there was not a book of any
kind at the station. The parents made no objection
to his reading the burial service over the poor baby,
out of a little prayer-book which he happened to have
in his pocket, and he went away determined to do his
part towards making good the deficiency he had discovered;
for on investigation it was found that very
many Light-houses were quite as much cut off from
books as the one he had visited, and one instance had
occurred of a poor fellow who had actually gone
crazy, from sheer mental starvation, in his loneliness.
</p>
<p>Many persons have interested themselves in
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s scheme. An appropriation has been asked
from Congress for supplying reading matter to the
six hundred and more Light-houses along our coast;
and in the mean time private individuals have sent in
contributions in the way of old books and magazines.
The lady and gentlemen clerks at the Light-house
Board have been most kind and helpful in the matter;
for they always feel an interest in the condition of the
keepers and their families, and when cases of suffering
come to their knowledge, as lately, when a keeper
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
at the South was burnt out and lost all his possessions,
are prompt with their assistance. In this instance
they helped to sort and arrange the motley
piles of donated literature, which was then bound up
nicely, in uniform volumes, at the Government Printing
Office, and a neat little library-case of strong oak
wood was made, fitted up with shelves and having
heavy metal clasps and handles; and just so many
volumes, always including a Bible, were placed in each
case.
</p>
<p>The Store-ships will now go out with a goodly lading
of these supplies; one will be left at each station,
and the next time the ship comes round the old case
will be taken away and a fresh one substituted. In
this way a circulating library system is established,
and every Keeper well supplied with abundance of
wholesome and entertaining reading matter.
</p>
<p>You children, with your wealth of books and delightful
magazines coming every month, can perhaps
hardly appreciate the boon this kind thought, so well
carried out, will prove; for you have never known
what it is to be shut up in a lonely tower, day after
day, month after month, with no outside interest or
amusement. You can do your part towards brightening
the lives of these men with their wives and children,
and I am sure you will be glad of the opportunity.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
Many of you, no doubt, have piles of old
magazines or story papers, or even of books, for which
you have no further use. Would you not like to put
up a nice package of these, and send them by Express
to the &#8220;Care of the Chief Clerk of the Light-house
Board, Washington, D.&nbsp;C.&#8221;?
</p>
<p>New supplies are constantly needed, and in this
way you could not fail to give pleasure to those who
have little enough in a life of monotonous duty.

<p>Last summer while on our vacation
trip along the sea-coast
we made our plans so as to
stop over a train at Barnstable
that we might have time to
take a look at that ancient
burgh, but found to our dismay
when it was too late, that
of <i>time</i> we had altogether too
much, for when we stepped out
of the car it was seven o&#8217;clock in the morning, and our
train would not leave till four in the afternoon! And
to make matters worse it began to rain. We managed,
however, at intervals when the rain held up,
to get a pretty good idea of the place, but were
driven back to the station by the persistent drizzle
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
long before noon; and there we seemed destined to
spend five tedious hours, with not much of anything
to do, except to get the way-bills of the Old Colony
Railroad by heart, and commit to memory whatever
might be available in the other advertisements posted
on the walls.

THE BLIND BROOM-MAKER OF BARNSTABLE.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>We were beginning to be desperate, when my companion,
strolling about, discovered a small placard
saying that fruit was for sale in the freight depot. I
set out to explore, having visions of apples and
pears, but especially peaches and grapes before me.
</p>
<p>Passing the wide freightage doors, I came to a
narrow one which was wide open; so I first looked,
and then walked in. It was an unfinished place
where a slim young woman was busy about her
housework, while a sick-looking man was &#8220;standing
round.&#8221; There was a cooking-stove, and she was
taking pies out of the oven, which she set in a row
on a cumbrous wooden bench that filled all the
opposite end of the room, and under it were stored
bunches of something unknown to me which I found
afterwards was broom-corn. She was pretty and
girlish, and had blue eyes, and fair hair.
</p>
<p>She asked me to sit down, and told me they had
been living there off and on for three years. &#8220;We
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
used to live in &#8216;Commons,&#8217; but we did not like, and
so came up here. My husband is not well, and I go
out washing, and take in washing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a very queer place to live in, but neat and
comfortable, yet it seemed just as if they might have
been moving, and had merely stopped here over
night and set up their stove in order to cook something
to eat.
</p>
<p>Upon inquiring for the fruit, about which it began
to seem as if there must be either a mistake or a
mystery for nothing of the kind was to be seen
except the dish of apples left over from the pies, she
directed me up-stairs; and up the steep narrow
stairs I went, nearly stumbling over a great black
dog (which she assured me would not bite) that lay
stretched at the threshold of a dreary kind of room
which had one occupant&mdash;a man with his shirtsleeves
rolled up to the elbows at work near one of
the windows at the farther end. And now I remembered
that we had seen him at his bench there as we
sat in the depot, and wondered what he was doing.
</p>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
A GAY CAVALCADE.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>No indications of fruit; but there were four machines
and a stack of brooms, and the litter of shreds
and waste, and I was about to retreat with an apology
after making known my errand. He said I had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
made no mistake, but he was out of everything except
confectionery; peanuts, dates and figs. So as there
were no apples, no pears, no peaches, no grapes,
after all my perseverance, <i>dates</i> I would have, and
he went to a closet where he said he kept them,
holding his hands out before him in such a way that
I knew he could not see even before he said, &#8220;I am
blind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After he had weighed them and received his pay,
there were a few words about his business, which he
seemed delighted to talk about, and because I put
a question or two, he asked if I was a reporter, and
said &#8220;that used to be my business. I was on the
reportorial staff of the Pennsylvania legislature, when
from overtasking my eyes, and other causes, I became
blind. I went to the Institution at South
Boston, and learned to make brooms so that I could
earn my living.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was full of interest in the work he had been
compelled to fall back upon, and invited me to come
in with my companion and see how it was done.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I wish,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that I had some stuff
ready. I have to soak it before I use it. But your
train does not go till four o&#8217;clock. I will put some
to soak immediately, and if you will come in about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
three I will begin at the beginning and make a
broom, so that you can then see the whole process.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To be sure we were glad to go, and he did as he
said he would, and explained every particular, even
to the cost.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The broom-corn comes from the West,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;though a good deal grows in the Mohawk valley, and
the largest broom establishment in the United States
is at Schenectady.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It often grows, if thriving stalks, ten or twelve
feet tall; it can be cultivated here, but not so profitably.
It comes in large bales, weighing anywhere
from one hundred and fifty to five hundred pounds.
Where I buy mine in Boston it costs me six cents a
pound, though the price varies.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I sort it out on a &#8216;sorting bench,&#8217; first, for if I
took it as it is, the brooms would be of queer qualities.
Sorting is a regular trade to learn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The next thing, I tie it in bundles, and then it is
ready for use. I put as many of these to soak the
night before, as I want to make up in the day. I
leave it in the water half an hour, then let it drain,
and it keeps damp enough for working; if it was
dry it would break when I sew it. Here you see
this lot, from which I shall make the broom. I call
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
now we have wire, and it is galvanized to prevent it
from rusting. It costs me twelve cents a pound; it
used to cost seventeen.&#8221;

THE COMEDY OF BROOMS&mdash;MAMMA&#8217;S LITTLE HOUSEMAID.

</div>

<p>Having made the handle fast, he took a bunch of
the corn, smoothed it carefully through his hands to
even it, laid it against the handle, put his foot on
the treadle or whatever the hour-glass shaped piece
of mechanism might be named, and with one or two
revolutions wired it tight. This lot had the butts
left on, but from the next layer he sliced them down
wedge-fashion with a very sharp knife, having secured
them to those already on by a strap which
could be fastened at such length as he chose by
means of a leather button; another and another tier,
each time of choicer quality, succeeded, and so on
till the stock for that broom was used up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;is a number eight broom.
If there had been time I would have made a <i>hurl</i>
broom, which is the best. (The &#8216;hurl&#8217; is the finest
part of the corn, the heart.) I make five sizes:
number six is the smallest, and it is the smallest
manufactured in this country. I can make twenty
of those in a day. Of the number ten, the hurl, I
have made twelve, and they sell for forty cents
apiece. Sometimes when I have got a lot of brooms
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
on hand I hire a horse and cart, take a boy with me,
and go round the country to sell them; and people
will object to paying my prices, and I can&#8217;t always
make them believe that it pays to buy a good article,
even if it is a broom. They sometimes say that
they can get enough of them at fourteen cents, but I
tell them when they pay fourteen cents for a broom,
they only get a fourteen-cent broom.&#8221;

<p>He had now a rough broom, which he released
from the vise and took over to the press which had
three pairs of cruel-looking irons that he said were
&#8220;the jaws,&#8221; of sizes to shut round brooms of three
different thicknesses and hold firmly, while he did
the next thing, which he made known in this wise:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I shall sew it. The number six have only
two sewings&mdash;all they need, they are so thin. The
others have three. They are all sewed with waxed
linen twine: the higher sizes have pink, because it
looks better; the others have tow-colored. You see
my needle? It is some like a sail-maker&#8217;s, but not
exactly. I have two, though one will last a lifetime.
I keep them in this oiled rag to prevent them from
rusting. They cost fifty cents apiece, and were made
of the very best of steel. See what nice metal it
is!&#8221; He held out one, shaped more like a paddle
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
than anything else, polished to the last degree, and
as lustrous as silver; then he threw it on the floor
to show us how it would ring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Broom tools of all kinds are made at Schenectady,
but my needles, knives and combs come from
Hadley. I will show you the combs pretty soon;
the knives you have already seen. Let me see&mdash;where
did I lay that other needle? No, you need
not look for it; I must find it myself. I have to be
careful where I leave my things, so that I can put my
hand on them the moment I want them. Oh, here
it is,&#8221; picking it up with his long supple fingers, and
rolling it securely up in the oiled cloth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you notice I put on this <i>palm</i>,&#8221; and he
held up what looked like a mitt just large enough to
cover the palm of the hand and the wrist, having a
hole to slip the thumb through and leaving that and
the fingers free. It was made of cowhide, and
sewed together on the back, while in the inside was
set a thimble against which the needle was to be
pressed in doing the hard sewing, while the leather
protected the skin from being fretted by the
broom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not just like a sail-maker&#8217;s palm,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;I have one of those which a man gave me, and I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
will show it to you.&#8221; So going again to his dark
closet, he groped for it among his multifarious
things, and came back with one similar, except that
it was of raw-hide, and the thimble was a little projection
looking like a pig&#8217;s toe.

&#8220;PLANT THE BROOM!&#8221;

</div>

<p>He sewed the broom through and through, producing
the three pink rows. Then he said he would
comb it to clear away the loose and broken stems;
and so he passed through it a sort of hetchel made
of thirty small knife-blades set in a frame, &#8220;which
cost me,&#8221; said he, &#8220;more than you would think&mdash;that
comb was five dollars; and now I comb it
out with this one to remove the small stuff and the
seeds.&#8221; And releasing it from the clamp, he took
down a fine comb from a nail, and repeated the
process.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now it is ready to be trimmed. I lay it on
this hay-cutter, which some friends bought cheap for
me at a fair, and answered my purpose after a few
alterations, and I trim it off, nice and even at one
end&mdash;and now it is done. You have seen a broom
made.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That was true. Our only regret was that we could
not have that same broom to take away; but on our
zig-zag journey, when we were likely enough to stop
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
over or turn off anywhere, that was an absurdity
not to be thought of. We did, however, &#8220;buy a
broom&#8221; that we <i>could</i> take&mdash;and an excellent one it
proved&mdash;and we accepted a small package of broom-corn
seed which the blind workman was anxious
we should have, &#8220;to plant in some spare spot just
to see how it looks when growing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When we went down-stairs, the woman was out
on the platform, her yellow hair tossing about in the
wind, and she seemed as happy with her meagre
accommodations in the freight house as if she were
owner of a mansion. She begged us to go in and
get some of her apples, we were welcome, and &#8220;they
did not cost me anything,&#8221; she added. She told us
more about her fellow-tenant, and said he paid half
the rent, &#8220;and he used to board with us, but now
he boards up in town, and he goes back and forth
alone, his self.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>This curious and pleasant little episode made us
so ready to be interested in everything pertaining
to brooms that it seemed a kind of sarcasm of circumstances
when, at a junction not very far along
our route, we saw, perched upon his cart, a pedler
doing his best to sell his brooms to the crowd on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
their way home from one of the Cape camp-meetings.
His words were just audible as the train went on:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Buy a broom! Buy a broom! Here&#8217;s the place
to buy a cheap broom, for <i>fourteen</i> cents! <i>only</i>
fourteen cents! A broom for fourteen cents! So
<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>CHEAP</span>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And it happened not many days later that somebody
read in our hearing that the broom-corn is
a native of India, and that Dr. Franklin was the
means of introducing it into this country; from seeing
a whisk of it in the hands of a lady he began to
examine it&mdash;being of an inquiring mind, as everybody
knows&mdash;and found a seed, which he planted.
</p>
<p>The street-sweeper&#8217;s broom is the genuine <i>besom</i>,
made of birch stems, cut out in the country, and
brought into town tied up in bundles like fagots;
suitable enough for those stalwart men who drag
them along so leisurely, but burdensome for the
hands of the wretched little waifs, who, tattered and
unkempt, make a pretence of keeping the crossings
clean; who first sweep, and then hold out a small
palm for the penny, dodging the horses&#8217; hoofs, and
just escaping by a hair&#8217;s breadth the wheels of truck
or omnibus in their attempts to secure the coin, if
some pitiful passer-by stops at the piping call:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Please ma&#8217;am, a penny!&#8221;
</p>
<p>That is the almost tragic prose of brooms.

<p>But there is a bit of poetic history that ought not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
to be forgotten, for it was a sprig of the lovely broom
bush&mdash;call it by the daintier name of heath if you
will&mdash;such as in some of its varieties grows wild in
nearly every country in Europe, a tough little flowering
evergreen, symbol of humility, which was once
embroidered on the robes, worn in the helmet, and
sculptured on the effigies of a royal house of England.
Which of the stories of its origin is true, perhaps
no one at this distant day can determine; but
whether a penitent pilgrim of the family was scourged
by twigs of it&mdash;the <i>plantagenesta</i>&mdash;or a gallant hunter
plucked a spray of it and put in his helmet, it is
certain that the humble plant gave the stately name
of &#8220;Plantagenet&#8221; to twelve sovereigns of that kingdom;
and their battle-cry&mdash;which meant to them
conquest and dominion, but has a very practical
sound to us, and a specially prosaic meaning to one
like the blind broom-maker of this simple story&mdash;was
this:

<h2>TALKING BY SIGNALS.</h2>
</div>

<p>When boys live some distance apart, it is
pleasant to be able to communicate with
each other by means of signals. Many and ingenious
have been the methods devised by enthusiastic
boys for this purpose. But it can be brought much
nearer perfection than has yet been done, by means
of a very simple system.
</p>
<p>At the age of fourteen I had an intimate friend
who lived more than a mile away, but whose home
was in plain sight from mine. As we could not
always be together when we wished, we invented a
system of signalling requiring a number of different
colored flags; but we were not quite satisfied with
it, for we could send but few communications by its
use. Then, when we came to test it, we found the
distance was too great to allow of the different colors
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
being distinguished. The white one was plainly visible.
It seemed necessary, therefore, that only
white flags should be used. We studied over the
problem long and hard, with the following result.
</p>
<p>We each made five flags by tacking a small stick,
eighteen inches long, to both ends of a strip of white
cloth,<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B"></a><a href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> two feet long by ten inches wide. Then we
nailed loops of leather to the side of our fathers&#8217;
barns, so that, when the sticks were inserted in them,
the flags would be in the following positions:

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></div>
<p>The upper left hand position was numbered 1,
upper right 2, lower right 3, lower left 4, centre 5.
Notice, there was no difference in the <i>flags</i>; the <i>positions</i>
they occupied determined the communication.
</p>
<p>Thirty combinations of these positions can be made:

<p>These combinations were written down; and opposite
each was written the question or answer for
which it stood. The answers likely to be used most
we placed opposite the shortest combinations, to
save time in signalling. My old &#8220;Code&#8221; lies before
me, from which I copy the following examples:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin: 0 auto 0 auto;  margin-left:2em;'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>1. <i>Yes.</i></p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>4. <i>Afternoon.</i></p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>5. <i>Evening.</i></p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>1 2. <i>Can you come over?</i></p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>1 3. <i>When?</i></p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>2 4 5. <i>Are you well to-day?</i></p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Suppose, now, that I place flags in positions 2 4
and 5. (See the above examples.)
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>Harry glances down his &#8220;code&#8221; until he reaches
2 4 5 and its signification, and perhaps answers with
a flag at 1.
</p>
<p>Then the following dialogue ensues:
</p>
<p>I. 1 2.
</p>
<p>He. 1 5.
</p>
<p>I. 4.
</p>
<p>He. 2 5.
</p>
<p>And, in a few moments,
</p>
<p>He. 1.
</p>
<p>We usually spent our noon hour conversing with
each other in this manner; and, when it became
necessary for either to leave his station, all the flags,
1 2 3 4 5, were put out, signifying &#8220;gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>One combination, 1 2 3 4, was, by mutual consent,
reserved for a communication of vital importance,
&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Come over!</span>&#8221; It was never to be used except in
time of trouble, when the case would warrant leaving
everything to obey the call. We had little expectation
of its ever being used. It was simply a whim;
although, like many other things, it served a serious
purpose in the end.
</p>
<p>Not far from my father&#8217;s house stood a valuable
timber lot, in which he took an especial pride.
Adjoining this was an old apple-orchard, where the
limbs of several trees that had been cut down, and
the prunings of the remainder, had been heaped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
together in two large piles to be burned at a favorable
opportunity. One afternoon, when there was
not the slightest breath of wind, we armed ourselves,
father and I, with green pine boughs and set the
brush-heaps a-fire. We had made the heap in as
moist a spot as possible, that there might be less
danger of the fire spreading through the grass.
While the flame was getting under way, I busied
myself in gathering stray bits of limbs and twigs&mdash;some
of them from the edge of the woods&mdash;and
throwing them on the fire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful not to put on any hemlock branches!&#8221;
shouted my father from his heap. &#8220;The sparks may
snap out into the grass!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Almost as he spoke a live coal popped out with a
loud snap and fell at my feet, and little tongues of
flame began to spread through the dead grass. A
few blows from my pine bough had smothered them,
when snap! snap! snap! went three more in different
directions. As I rushed to the nearest I remembered
throwing on several dead hemlock branches,
entirely forgetting their snapping propensity.
</p>
<p>Bestowing a few hasty strokes upon the first spot of
spreading flame, I hastened to the next and was vigorously
beating that, when, glancing behind me, I
saw to my dismay that the first was blazing again.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
Ahead of me was another, rapidly increasing; while
the roaring, towering flame at the heap was sputtering
ominously, as if preparing to send out a shower
of sparks. And, to make matters worse, I felt a
puff of wind on my face. Terror-stricken I shouted:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Father! The fire is running! Come quick!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a moment he was beside me, and for a short
time we fought the flame desperately.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll reach the woods in spite of us!&#8221; he gasped,
as we came together after a short struggle. &#8220;There
isn&#8217;t a neighbor within half a mile, and before you
could get help it would be too late! Besides, one
alone couldn&#8217;t do anything against it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A sudden inspiration seized me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to signal to Harry!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;If he
sees it he&#8217;ll come and, perhaps, bring help with
him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry!&#8221; he shouted back, and I started for the
barn. The distance was short. As I reached it I
glanced over to Harry&#8217;s. There were some white
spots on his barn. He was signalling and, of course,
could see my signal.
</p>
<p>Excitedly I placed the flags in 1 2 3 4, and, without
waiting for an answer, tore back across the fields
to the fire. It was gaining rapidly. In a large circle,
a dozen rods across, it advanced toward the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
buildings on one hand and swept toward the woods
on the other. We could not conquer it. We could
only hope to hinder its progress until help should
arrive.
</p>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
IN OBEDIENCE TO THE SIGNALS.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Fifteen minutes of desperate struggle and then,
with a ringing cheer, Harry and his father dashed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
upon the scene. Their arrival infused me with new
courage; and four pairs of hands and four willing
hearts at length conquered the flame, two rods from
the woods!
</p>
<p>My father sank down upon a rock, and, as he
wiped the perspiration from his smutty face, he said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, boys, your signalling has saved the prettiest
timber lot in the town of Hardwick! I shall
not forget it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Were we not justly proud?
</p>
<p>Two days after I found upon my plate at breakfast
a small package, which contained two pretty little
spy-glasses.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they will enable you to enlarge your
&#8216;signal code,&#8217;&#8221; was all my father said when I
thanked him.
</p>
<p>We soon found that with the aid of the glasses we
could distinguish any color. So we made a set of
blue flags, which gave us thirty more communications
by using them in place of the white ones. And, by
mixing the blue flags with the white combinations
and the white with the blue combinations, over <i>two
hundred</i> communications could be signalled. Thus
we could converse with each other by the hour.
</p>
<p>The way we wrote down the mixed combinations
was, by using a heavy figure to represent a blue flag;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
as 1<b>2</b>4<b>5</b>, which meant that positions 1 and 4 were
occupied by white flags, 2 and 5 by blue ones.
</p>
<p>Blue flags can be inserted in the original thirty
combinations in the following manner: 1<b>2</b>, 12<b>3</b>,
1<b>23</b>, 123<b>4</b>, 12<b>34</b>, 1<b>2</b>3<b>4</b>, 1<b>23</b>4, 1<b>234</b>, 23<b>5</b>, 2<b>35</b>,
234<b>5</b>, 23<b>4</b>5, 2<b>3</b>45, 2<b>3</b>4<b>5</b>, 2<b>34</b>5, 23<b>45</b>, 2<b>345</b>, and
so on.
</p>
<p>Among the many recollections that throng my
memory in connection with this subject, is that of an
incident which has caused me many a hearty laugh
since its occurrence, although at the time I did not
feel particularly amused. Harry had gone away
visiting, giving me no definite idea of when he would
return. So, one drizzling, uncomfortable day, as I
was sitting rather disconsolate at my barn window, I
was delighted to see several flags appear on his barn.
</p>
<p>Eagerly I read:
</p>
<p>1 3 4. &#8220;<i>Can you go a-fishing?</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>The fine drizzling rain was changing into larger
drops, and there was every reasonable prospect of a
very wet day, and I thought he must be joking; but
I answered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>When?</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Now</i>,&#8221; was the reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Where?</i>&#8221; I asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Bixbee&#8217;s pond.</i>&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Are you in earnest?</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I will meet you there.</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>I answered &#8220;<i>Yes</i>,&#8221; and, shouldering my fish-pole,
started off across-lots. The distance was fully a mile
and a half, and before I had passed over a quarter
of the distance the bushes, dripping with rain, had
completely drenched me. When nearly there the
increasing rain became a heavy shower; but I kept
on. I reached the pond, but nothing was to be seen
of Harry. Not a frog could I find for bait, owing to
the incessantly pouring rain, and I knew it would be
difficult to find a worm. So, after half an hour of
tedious waiting and monotonous soaking, I started
for Harry&#8217;s, my patience entirely worn out.
</p>
<p>The rain came down in torrents as, at length, I
turned in at the gate; and I suppose I looked as forlorn
as a drenched rooster, for I heard a girlish giggle
as I stepped upon the piazza, but I did not then
suspect the truth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Harry?&#8221; I asked of his mother whom I
found alone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you didn&#8217;t expect to find him at home, did
you? He won&#8217;t be back for a number of days yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>(Another subdued giggle from the next room.)
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re as wet as a drowned rat!&#8221; went on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
motherly woman. &#8220;What on earth started you out
in this rain?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that Hattie&#8217;s work!&#8221; I burst out angrily,
and told her the whole story.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; she exclaimed, holding up her hands,
despairingly, &#8220;I never did see such a torment as
that girl is! I noticed she has seemed very much
tickled over something! I&#8217;ll give her a real scolding!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I darted out the door; and, as I splashed my way
disconsolately down to the road, I heard a voice,
struggling between repentance and a desire to laugh,
call after me:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me, Charlie, but it was <i>such</i> a joke!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hattie never meddled with her brother&#8217;s signals
again. For her mother&#8217;s displeasure and the severe
cold that followed my drenching more than balanced
the enjoyment she derived from that very
practical joke.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Two years ago I visited my native town. Resuming
my old place by the barn window, I gazed across
the intervening forest to where Harry used to stand
and signal to me. Tacked up against the window-sill
was my old &#8220;signal code,&#8221; covered with dust
and cobwebs. Harry was hundreds of miles away,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
carving himself a name among his fellow-men. Of
all the friends of former days, scarcely one remained
in the old town. And I could only wish, with all my
heart, that I were once again enjoying my boyhood&#8217;s
happy hours.

<h2>JENNIE FINDS OUT HOW DISHES ARE MADE.</h2>
</div>

<p>Ah! I know something! I know something
you girls don&#8217;t know! I know how they
make dishes what you eat off of; and it&#8217;s just the
same way they make dolly&#8217;s dishes, I guess.
</p>
<p>Yes, I <i>do</i> know. And I&#8217;ve got some pictures papa
<i>drawed</i> for me, too, and I&#8217;ll tell you all about them.
They&#8217;re in my pocket right under my handkerchief.
I put them under my handkerchief because I don&#8217;t
want them to get dirty. I&#8217;ve got some &#8217;lasses candy
on top. I haven&#8217;t got enough, or I&#8217;d give you all
some.
</p>
<p>Papa took me to a <i>pottery</i>. I don&#8217;t know why they
call it a pottery, for they make cups and saucers, and
sugar-bowls, and everything. First the man took us
through the <i>dressing-room</i>. I did not see any dresses,
nor anybody dressing themselves. I only saw piles
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
of dishes and men and women hammering at them.
I asked papa why they called it that, and he said,
wait till we come back, for that was the very last of
all. So we went on into the yard. I looked into
one part of the building where it was all dark, with
three great chimneys, broad on the ground and narrow
high up. But the man and papa went right on,
round to the other side of the building.
</p>
<p>There wasn&#8217;t anything to see, though, but horses
and carts hauling clay, and great heaps of it on the
ground. I wouldn&#8217;t have called it anything but dirt,
but papa said it was <i>kaolin</i>, not exactly dirt, but clay.
He spelt it for me.
</p>
<p>There was another of those big chimneys in the
yard, only bigger. The man said that was where
they dried the clay. Then he led us to a little door
in the side of the house, and we went in. That
brought us into a little room where they were getting
the clay ready.
</p>
<p>First there was a sand-screen&mdash;like Mike uses,
where they sieved it.
Next they weighed it
and put it into bins.
It looked like fine,
dark flour.
</p>

<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></div>
<p>A little piece off from the bins there was a big
deep box. They were mixing clay and water in it,
and making a paste. It looked like lime when
they&#8217;re making mortar. The box leaked awfully,
and white paste was running down on the floor.
</p>
<p>At the end of the box they had a pump working,
and it was pumping the paste into what they called
a <i>press</i>. It was too funny for anything. I couldn&#8217;t
more than half understand it. But it looks something
like a baby-crib, only it has slats across the
top, and they&#8217;re close together. They have a lot of
bags inbetween the slats, and the clay gets into
the bags and gets pressed flat, so that most of the water
is squeezed out. When they take it out of the
bags it looks something like a sheet of shortcake
before it&#8217;s cut or baked. Then they roll a lot of
them together, and that&#8217;s what they make dishes out
of. They call it <i>biscuit</i>.
</p>
<p>The man took us down into the cellar under the
little room to show us the engine that made the paste
and pumped and pressed the clay. I was afraid, and
didn&#8217;t want to go down, but papa said it was only a
little one. It was nice and clean down there, with a
neat brick floor, but awful hot. I was glad to come
up.

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></div>
<p>After the little room there&#8217;s one big room where
they don&#8217;t do much of anything. It is like a large
shed, for it is dark and has no floor. The dressing-room
where we were first is on one side, and the dark
room where the big chimneys are, is back of it. We
went through it, and over to one side and up the
stairs to the second story.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice up there. It&#8217;s one great big room, five
times as big as our Sunday School room, with ever so
many windows. All around the sides and down the
middle, and cross-ways, and out in the wings are
shelves, piled full of brand-new dishes. And there
are tables all along the walls, and that&#8217;s where they
make them. I could stand and look all day.
</p>
<p>I saw two boys throwing up a great big lump of
clay and catching it; then cutting it with a string
and putting the pieces together again, then throwing
it up again, until it made me dizzy to look at them.
I asked the man what they were doing, and he said,
<i>wedging the clay</i>. That means taking the air out.
They keep on doing that until there are no air-bubbles
in it.
</p>
<p>We stopped and talked to a man who was making
a sugar-bowl, and he told us how he did it. All the
men have on the table in front of them a lump of
clay, a wheel, some moulds, a sharp knife, a bucket
of water with a sponge in it, and something like the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
slab of a round, marble-topped table, only it&#8217;s made
of plaster Paris, to work on.

MOULD FOR<br />
A CUP.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>And do you know what the potter&#8217;s-wheel is? It&#8217;s
as old as the hills and it&#8217;s in the
Bible, but I guess everybody don&#8217;t
know what it is. It looks as if it
was made of hard, smooth, baked
white clay, and is something like
a grindstone, only not half as
thick. The grindstone stands up,
but this lays flat, with its round
side turned up, like the head of a barrel. And it&#8217;s
set on a pivot, like the needle of the compass in
our geographies.
</p>
<p>The moulds are like Miss Fanny&#8217;s wax-fruit moulds.
They&#8217;re made of plaster Paris, and they&#8217;re round
outside, and they have the shape of what the
man wants to make on the inside, and they&#8217;re in two
pieces. Little things like cups are made
in one mould; but big things like pitchers
are made in two or three pieces, in two
or three moulds, and then put together.
Handles and spouts and such things are
made separately in little moulds and put
on afterwards.

HANDLE<br />
MOULD.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Here&#8217;s the way. First the man cuts off
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
a piece of the biscuit, and kneads it on the plaster
Paris slab. Then he takes one piece of the mould,
fixes the clay in nicely, shaves off what he don&#8217;t want,
then puts on the other piece of the mould, and sets
it on the wheel. He gives it a shove and sets it spinning.
It stops itself after a while, then he opens the
mould, and there is the dish. The clay keeps the
same thickness all through, and fills both pieces of
the mould.

<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Then the man takes it out and sponges it. If it
isn&#8217;t just the right shape all he has to do is wet it,
and it will come right. Then he puts on the handle
or puts the pieces together, fixing them just so with
his fingers and knife. It isn&#8217;t very hard, but he has
to be careful. The soft dishes look real cute. Then
they&#8217;re ready to be burnt the first time.
</p>
<p>We walked all around and saw here one man making
cups, another, tureens, another, bird-baths, and
every imaginable thing that is ever made in porcelain.
Then we went down-stairs, through the dark rooms,
into where the tall chimneys are. Then I found out
they called them <i>kilns</i>. They have at the bottom a
prodigious furnace, over that a tremendous oven,
where they put the dishes in to bake.
</p>
<p>But they don&#8217;t put them right in just as they are.
Oh, no. There were on the high shelves all around, a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
lot of things called <i>saggers</i>. They look something like
bandboxes made of firebrick. The soft dishes are
put in them, the lids are put on, and then they are
piled up in the oven. Then the men build a big fire
in the furnace, and let it burn for several days.
When it goes out they let several more days go by for
the kiln to cool, and then take out the saggers. When
the dishes are taken out they are hard and rough and
of a yellowish white. They build the fire after they
get them in, and let it out and the kiln cool off before
they take them out, because the men have to go in
and out the big ovens.
</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t you think a pile of soft plates and saucers
would burn all together and stick fast to each other?
Well, they don&#8217;t. There are little things made of
hard clay with three bars and three feet, and they put
them in between dishes so that one plate has one in
it, and the next plate sets on top of that, so that they
can&#8217;t stick together. Did you ever see three little
dark spots on the bottom of a saucer? This is what
makes them. There are lots and lots of these little
stands lying all around everywhere, and broken pieces
of them and the clay, scattered like flour all over the
ground and floors thick.
</p>
<p>We next went into the room back of the kilns. It
had shelves all around, too, and there were piles of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
dishes after the first burning. A lot of women sat on
stools on the floor and they were
brushing the fire cracks with some
stuff out of little bottles. This was
to fill them up so that the glazing
wouldn&#8217;t run in.

REST FOR FLAT<br />
DISHES.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>We went into another room at one
side of the first and there&#8217;s where they did the glazing.
They called it <i>dipping</i>. There was a large tank
in the middle of the room with a deep red liquid in
it. Papa asked the man what it was, and he said it
was a secret preparation. The men dipped the
dishes in, and they came out a beautiful pink, so
pretty that it seemed a pity they couldn&#8217;t stay so.
There were shelves all around this room, too, and
there the dishes look like they do when we see them&mdash;the
pink glazing has turned white.
</p>
<p>There is nothing more done to them except the
<i>dressing</i>. We had now gone all around, and were
almost at the <i>dressing-room</i> where we started. And
when we went in again we found that the dressing
was nothing but knocking off any rough lumps with a
chisel. I remember every bit of it. And every time
I look at dishes I think there are ever so many things
we use every day and don&#8217;t know anything about.

<h2>ARCHERY FOR BOYS.</h2>
</div>

<p>Mr. Maurice Thompson has excited all
the grown-up boys who loved in their younger
days to draw the bow, by his graceful articles on
archery for young men and women.
</p>
<div class='figleft'>
<img src='images/illus-071.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;width:101px;'>
Fig. A.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>I want to tell the boys who are wide awake how
they may, without too much labor and with but little
expense, make their own bows and arrows and targets,
having <i>their</i> fun, like their elders, in this health-giving
and graceful recreation.
</p>
<p>In the first place, after you have made your implements
for the sport, you must never shoot at or
towards anyone; nor must you ever shoot directly
upwards. In the one case you may maim some one
for life, and in the other you may put out your own
eye as an acquaintance of the writer&#8217;s once did
in Virginia.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>To make a bow take a piece of
any tough, elastic wood, as cedar,
ash, sassafras or hickory, well-seasoned,
about your own length.
Trim it so as to taper gradually
from the centre to the ends, keeping
it flat, at first, until you have
it as in this sketch&mdash;for a boy,
say, five feet in height: (Fig. A)
</p>
<p>This represents a bow five feet
long, one and a quarter inches
broad in the middle, three-fourths
of an inch thick at the centre,
and a half-inch scant at the ends
in breadth and thickness.
</p>
<p>Bend the bow across your knee,
pulling back both ends, one in each
hand, the centre against your knee,
and see whether it is easily bent,
and whether it springs readily
back to its original position.
If so your bow is about the right
size. Cut near each end the
notch for the string
as in this figure:
(Fig. B.)
</p>
<div class='figright'>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;width:160px;'>
Fig. B.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></div>
<p>Bevel the side of the bow which is to be held
towards you, so that a section
of your bow will look like this
figure: (Fig. C.)
</p>
<div class='figleft'>
<img src='images/illus-073.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;width:136px;'>
Fig. C.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The back or flat part is
held from you in shooting, and the bevelled or
rounded part towards you. Scrape the bow with
glass and smooth it with sand-paper.
</p>
<p>To shape your bow lay it on a stout,
flat piece of timber, and drive five ten-penny
nails in the timber, one at the
centre of your bow, and the others
as in figure below, so as to bend the
ends for about six inches in a direction
contrary to the direction in which
you draw the bow: (Fig. D.)
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-074.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
Fig. D. (A and B are six inches from the ends.<br />
The bow is bent slightly at C.)
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Your bow is now finished as far as
the wood-work is concerned, and you
may proceed to wrap it from end to
end with silk or colored twine, increasing
its elasticity and improving the appearance.
The ends of the wrap
must be concealed as in wrapping a
fish-hook. Glue with Spaulding&#8217;s glue
a piece of velvet or even red flannel
around the middle to mark your handhold.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
The ends may in like manner be ornamented
by glueing colored pieces upon them.
</p>
<p>A hempen string, whipped in the middle with
colored silk, to mark the place for your arrow nock to
be put, in shooting, will make a very good string.
</p>
<p>For arrows any light, tough wood, which splits
straight, will do. I use white pine, which may be
gotten from an ordinary store-box, and for hunting-arrows
seasoned hickory. These must be trimmed
straight and true, until they are in thickness about
the size of ordinary cedar pencils, from twenty-five to
twenty-eight inches in length. They must be feathered
and weighted either with lead or copper, or by
fastening on sharp awl-points or steel arrow-points
with wire.
</p>
<p>I used to make six different kinds; a simple
copper-wrap, a blunt leaden head, a sharp leaden
head like a minie bullet, an awl-point wrapped with
copper wire and soldered, and a broad-head hunting-arrow.
</p>
<p>To make a copper wrap, wrap with copper wire the
last half-inch of the arrow until you get near the end,
then lay a needle as large as your wire obliquely
along the arrow as in this figure: (Fig. E.) Continue
the wrapping until you have weighted the arrow
sufficiently; draw out the needle and thrust the end
</p>

<p>of your wire through the little passage kept by the
needle, and draw it tight thus: (Fig. F.)

<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>A blunt leaden head is made by pouring three or
four melted buck-shot into a cylinder of paper,
wrapped around the end of the arrow, slightly larger
at the open end, and tied on by a piece of thread.
The wood of the
arrow must be
cut thus: (Fig. H.)
</p>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>

<p>It should look like this after the metal has
been poured in
and the paper
all stripped off.

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>

<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>An awl-point arrow is made by inserting the point
in the end of the arrow, wrapping with copper wire,
and getting a tinner to drop some solder at the end
to fasten the
wire and awl-point
firmly
together. The
awl-point looks
like this: (Fig. K.)

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>

<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The awls (like Fig. L.) are filed like this
into teeth-like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
notches on the part
going into the
wood, and roundly
sharp on the other

<p>These may be shot into an
oak-tree and extracted by a twist of the hand close to
the arrow-point.

<img src='images/illus-085.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
Fig. N.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The broad-head
hunting-point (Fig. N.) is put on by
slitting the arrow
and inserting the
flat handle of the
arrow point, and
wrapping it with silk, sinews, or copper wire. These
points can be sharpened along the line A B on a
whetstone, and will cut like knives. The hunting
arrow looks like this: (Fig. O.)
</p>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>

</div>

<p>To feather an arrow you strip a goose feather from
the quill and, after clipping off the part near the
quill-end, you mark a line down the arrow from a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
point one inch from the nock and, spreading some
Spaulding&#8217;s glue along that line apply the feather,
lightly pressing it home with forefinger and thumb.
After you have glued on one piece lay aside the
arrow and fix another, and so on until the first is
set, so that you may put on another piece. When
you have fastened these feathers on each arrow lay
them aside for ten or twelve hours. The three
feathers will look like this: (Fig. P.)

</div>

<p>A boy can hardly make a good quiver unless he
were to kill some furred animal and make a cylindrical
case such as the Indians have, out of its skin.
I am afraid that he usually would have to get a harness-maker
to make him a quiver out of leather,
somewhat larger at the top than at the bottom. It
should hold from eight to twelve arrows.
</p>
<p>A good target may be made of soft pine, circular
or elliptical in shape. In the latter case a line-shot
might count, even though it were farther from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
centre. Pieces should be tacked to the back of this
target at right angles to the grain of the wood.
Differently-colored circles or rings, a little more than
the width of an arrow, must be painted on this, with a
centre twice the width of an arrow. The outer ring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
counts one, the next two, three, four and so on to
the centre, which of course counts highest. By this
plan one&#8217;s score could be told with perfect accuracy.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<img src='images/illus-088.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
THE TARGET.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>If an arrow struck on a line between number three
and four it counts three and a half. Anything like
this rarely happens. The target is fixed upon an
easel formed of three pieces of wood fastened
together by a string at the top, and it ought to lean
back at the top slightly, away from the archer.
</p>
<p>The three arrows count seven, nine, ten&mdash;twenty-six
in all. In target-shooting you should use awl-pointed,
wire-wrapped arrows, as they can be easily drawn out
of even a wooden target.

<h2>DOLLY&#8217;S SHOES.</h2>
</div>

<p>I can&#8217;t help wondering if any of the little
maidens who are having so much comfort
with their beloved dolls in these Christmas
holidays, ever think that <i>somebody</i>
must have taken a great deal of pains to
dress them up so nicely, and above all,
to make the tiny garments and hats and
shoes.
</p>
<p>The doll&#8217;s <i>shoes</i>!&mdash;so pretty, so daintily
shaped, so beautifully stitched and
trimmed, so perfectly, faultlessly finished
from heel to toe, the &#8220;cunningest things&#8221;
in all dolly&#8217;s wardrobe&mdash;did it ever occur
to the girlie &#8220;playing mother,&#8221; to ask
where they came from, and by whose
dexterous fingers they were fashioned?
She knows well enough that when Angelina Christina,
or Luella Rosa Matilda Jennette, has worn
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
these out, there are enough to be bought in the toy
shops for twenty-five or thirty cents a pair; <i>but who
makes them?</i>
</p>
<p>That was the question which came into <i>my</i> head
one day, and I set to work to find out&mdash;doing just
what must suggest itself to anybody who wants information,
whatever the subject: that is to say, I went
to head-quarters, and asked questions.
</p>
<p>There are two places in Boston&mdash;one a &#8220;shoe and
leather exchange,&#8221; and the other the establishment of
an importer and dealer in shoe store supplies, where
they furnish doll&#8217;s shoes &#8220;to the trade,&#8221; as the phrase
is: one is on Congress street, and the other on Hanover;
and the proprietors, Mr. Daniels and Mr.
Swanberg, instead of being amused at my errand,
very kindly told me what I wanted to know.
</p>
<p>Some of the shoes are imported, but they are inferior
in style to those made in this country&mdash;notwithstanding
they come from Paris, and everything
from that place is supposed superlatively choice and
to be desired, as you are very well aware. In the
United States there is one factory&mdash;and but one,
so far as I could ascertain&mdash;which supplies a large
quantity, about fifteen hundred dozens, for the American
market, sending them to all parts, and furnishing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
the toy-stores in Chicago and other western cities, as
well as New York, Philadelphia and Boston.
</p>
<p>This manufactory is at Bordentown, New Jersey,
and has been in existence about twelve years, and
the value of stock now sent out is about seven thousand
dollars a year; so much money for the wee feet
that run on no errands, and save no steps for anybody!
The wholesale jobbers of course advance
the price, and in the retail stores they are higher yet;
so that each tradesman through whose hands they
pass has his trifle of profit in helping to shoe the
feet of the doll-people. They retail from a dollar
and a dollar and a quarter a dozen, to three dollars
and seventy-five cents, according to the style.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
DOLLY&#8217;S SHOES
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>They &#8220;run,&#8221; as the dealers express it, in twelve
sizes; the &#8220;common doll&#8217;s shoes&#8221; (which means
shoes for common dolls) vary, however, from the
class made for wax dolls, which have grades peculiar
to themselves, being not only extra full and wider in
the soles, but numbering fewer sizes, from one to six
only. Of the common kind, the slippers and ties run
from one to twelve, the others from three, four or five
to that number. They come packed in regular sizes,
a &#8220;full line,&#8221; as those for children do, or in assorted
sizes and styles; in small, square boxes, such as shoe
dealers know by the name of &#8220;cartoon,&#8221; which is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
another word for the French <i>carton</i>, meaning simply
that they are made of paste-board. The tiniest is not
much more than an inch long, but is a perfectly
formed and finished shoe on that miniature scale; and
the largest is almost big enough for Mrs. Tom Thumb,
measuring about four inches, and it could certainly
be worn by many a baby you have seen.
</p>
<p>As for the names, they come in this order:&mdash;slippers,
ties, ankle ties, Balmorals, buttoned boots, Polish
buttoned, Polish eyeletted, and Antoinette, which is
a heeled, croquet slipper, in which her doll-ship,
when engaged in that out-of-door game, can show off
her delicate, clocked stockings to advantage.
</p>
<p>But what shall I say of the variety in color and
trimmings? They are in white and crimson, in buff
and blue, in scarlet and purple, in rose color and
violet, in bronze and silver and gold, everything
but black, for dolls don&#8217;t like black except in the tips
of their gay Balmoral or Polish boots. And the stuff
they are made of is such soft material as can only
be found in goat and sheep and kid and glove kid,
and <i>skivers</i>, which is the name for split leather. I
strongly suspected that they were all made of scraps
left from large slippers and shoes, but, though this is
generally the case, some whole skins have to be used
because nothing is ever manufactured for real people
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
boots and shoes and slippers for all kinds of dolls,
high and low, rich and poor; to walk in, to dance in,
to play croquet in, or to stay at home in; to match
their costumes, to match their hair, to match their
eyes, to suit them if anything on earth <i>could</i> suit.
And every doll could be sure about her &#8220;size,&#8221; for the
number is stamped on the bottom of the soles; and I
must not forget to say that they have also the &#8220;trademark,&#8221;
which is the imprint under the number; this
&#8220;trade mark&#8221; is a pair of boots smaller than anything
you can think of.
</p>
<p>Now I am coming to the original question&mdash;&#8220;<i>who
makes them?</i>&#8221; They are made in large quantities
during about six months of the year, accumulating
in the summer, ready for the trade, which begins in
August, and drops off after the first of January, and
is over with for that season by March. In those six
working months the factory employs about forty
women, and they are mostly invalids or old persons
who are not able to do anything but light work, and
who receive only small wages, because they are not
capable of earning much. So they are generally
thin, pale hands and slender fingers which patiently
and skillfully fit the patterns, and sew the seams, and
do the even nice stitching, and dainty ornamentation,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
which help to make glad the hearts of the many little
girls all over the country, who have found a precious
doll, all so daintily shod, among the gifts of their
Merry Christmas.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
<h2>A GLIMPSE OF SOME MONTANA BEAVERS.</h2>
</div>

<p>Our road passed down along Hell-Gate river,
leaving Deer Lodge City some eight miles to
the left. As one goes down, the country changes, and
occasional pines appear along the banks of the stream,
and the landscape becomes much more interesting.
At one place, where a tiny tributary flows in, a large
community of beavers were building a dam. They
were not at all afraid of us, and so we leisurely observed
the process, wishing to settle the vexed question
as to whether beavers do actually do intelligent
mason-work.
</p>
<p>They had already sunk a great deal of brush, together
with limbs of trees, and were now filling this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
wicker-work in with earth and rocks which they procured
a little distance above on the opposite bank.
A beaver would run up, flatten his tail on the mud
near the bank, then another beaver would scrape the
earth up and upon the tail of the first, and pack it
down. After he had his load complete, the carrier-beaver
would swim away rapidly; his tail, with the
load of earth, floating on the surface, the swift movement
of the animal alone keeping it afloat.
</p>
<p>The sagacious creature would invariably swim to
the right place and dump the load, and then return
for another, the stream presenting a scene of great
activity, as several of these curious animal-masons
were constantly and swiftly passing and repassing
each other with their heavy loads.
</p>
<p>Others, the carpenters among them, were at work
in the thicket opposite, cutting brush. We saw
many large trees which had been cut down by
them. The stumps looked as though some boy
had chopped them down with a dull axe. It is surprising
to reflect upon the pertinacity of these creatures
which enables them to gnaw down such immense
trees, and the wisdom with which they calculate the
direction in which the trees will fall.
</p>
<p>It is said here that the beavers cut the limbs off
from these trees and then sever them into lengths of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
about three feet each, and after that float them to
the center of their pond, sink them to the bottom
and fasten them there, where they remain and are
used as food during the winter when the pond is frozen
over. This is thought to be one of the principal
uses of the pond&mdash;to provide a pantry which will
not freeze. The pond furnishes a depth of water
that is always still, and never freezes to the bottom.
</p>
<p>Although, after witnessing this almost human
sagacity, we had many compunctions, we concluded
to shoot one fine animal for his skin. We shot one
through the head. His companions immediately disappeared;
and before we could secure our wounded
beaver he also had dived beneath the waters of their
pond, and although we waited sometime in the vicinity,
we failed to discover him again. The inhabitants
say it is nearly impossible to kill a beaver with a
rifle, and never, on any occasion does the trapper
shoot one.

A MAINE WOOD-CHOPPER.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>All boys and girls
know that boards are
made of sawed logs,
and that logs are trunks of trees. Few, however, know
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
with what hardship and difficulty the trees are felled,
trimmed and carried from the woods where they grow
to the mills where they are made into boards.
</p>
<p>In the far West, and in the wilds of Maine, are acres
upon acres, and miles upon miles, of evergreen forests.
One wooded tract in Maine is so vast that it takes an
army of choppers twenty years to cut it over. By the
time it is done a new growth has sprung up, and an
intermediate one is large enough to cut; so the chopping
goes on year after year. The first or primeval
growth is pine. That is most valuable. After the
pines are cut, spruce and hemlock spring up and grow.

<p>Most of the men who live in the vicinity of the lake
region work in the woods in the winter. They camp
in tents and log huts near the tracts where they are
felling trees. All day long, day after day, week after
week, they chop down such trees as are large enough
to cut, lop off the branches and haul the logs to the
nearest water. This work is done in winter because
the logs are more easily managed over snow and ice.
All brooks large enough to carry them, all rivers, ponds
and lakes, are pressed into service and made to convey
the ponderous freight towards civilization. All along
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
the shores and in the woods are busy scenes&mdash;men,
oxen and horses hard at work, the smoke from the logging
camps curling among the trees.
</p>
<p>Every log has the initial or mark of the owner
chopped deep into the wood to identify it. Then,
when the ice breaks up, the logs are sent down the
brooks to the rivers and through the rivers to the
lakes. The logging camps are disbanded, the loggers
return to their homes, and the river-drivers alone are
left to begin their duties.
</p>
<p>The river-drivers are the men who travel with the
logs from the beginning of their journey till they are
surrendered to the saw-mills. Each wears shoes the
soles of which are thickly studded with iron brads an
inch long; and each carries a long pole called a
&#8220;pick-pole,&#8221; which has a strong sharp-pointed iron
spike in the end. This they drive into the wood, and
it supports and steadies them as they spring from log
to log.
</p>
<p>Their first duty is to collect &#8220;the drive.&#8221; The logs
which form &#8220;the drive&#8221; are packed together and held
in place by a chain of guard-logs which stretches entirely
around the drive, forming what is called &#8220;the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
boom.&#8221; The guard-logs are chained together at the
ends about two feet apart. The guard is always much
larger than the boom of logs, so that the shape of the
boom may be changed for wide or narrow waters.
</p>
<p>At the head of each boom is a raft which supports
two large windlasses, each of which works an anchor.
On this head-work about thirty river-drivers take up
their position to direct the course of the boom.
</p>
<p>To change its position or shape, ten of the drivers
spring into a boat or bateau; one takes a paddle at
the bow; eight take oars; and one, at the stern, holds
the anchor. They row with quick strokes toward the
spot where the anchor is to be dropped, the cable all
the time unwinding from the windlass.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let go!&#8221; shouts the foreman.
</p>
<p>Splash! goes the anchor overboard.
</p>
<p>The boat then darts back to the head-works. Out
spring the men to help turn the windlass to wind the
cable in. They sing as they work, and the windlass
creaks a monotonous accompaniment as &#8220;Meet me by
moonlight,&#8221; or the popular &#8220;Away over yonder,&#8221;
comes floating over the rippling water.

</div>

<p>Meanwhile another bateau has been out with another
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
anchor; and as both windlasses turn, the boom swings
toward the anchorage, and thus is so much further on
its way.
</p>
<p>Though the men sing as they work, and make the
best of their mishaps with jests and laughter, they
often carry homesick hearts. In cold and stormy
weather their hardships are great, an involuntary bath
in the icy water being an event of frequent occurrence.
Also their work demands a constant supply of strength
which is very trying; frequently a head wind will
drive them back from a position which it has taken
several days to gain, and all the toil of fresh anchorages
must be repeated.
</p>
<p>The most dangerous part of the work is &#8220;sluicing&#8221;
the logs. When the boom reaches the run which
connects the lake or river with the dam through the
sluice of which the logs must pass, the chain of guard-logs
is detached, and fastened in lines along both sides
of the run, and the rafts are drawn off to one side
and anchored to trees. The river-drivers, armed with
their pick-poles, are then stationed along the run, on
the dam, wherever they may be needed.
</p>
<p>The liberated logs now come sailing along, their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
speed quickening as they near the sluice. When
they reach it they dart through, their dull, rapid,
continuous thud mingling with the roar of the water.
How they shoot the sluice! log after log&mdash;two, six,
a dozen together&mdash;pitching, tossing, struggling, leaping
end over end; finally submitting to destiny and
sailing serenely down the river toward another lake.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the river-drivers with their long poles
and quick movements, looking not unlike a band of
savages, have enough to do, with steady feet, and eyes
on the alert. For of all the vast array of logs&mdash;and
I once saw twenty-four thousand in one drive&mdash;not
one goes through the sluice but is guided on to it by
one or more of the drivers. They often ride standing
on the floating logs, conducting this, pushing that,
hurrying another, straightening, turning and guiding;
and just before the log on which a driver stands
reaches the sluice, he springs to another.
</p>
<p>Woe to him if his foot should slip, or his leap fail!
He would be crushed among the logs in the sluice, or
dashed among the rocks in the seething water.

</p>

<p>After all the logs are safely sluiced, the chains of
the guards are slipped, the rafts are broken up, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
these, windlasses and all, follow the logs. Then the
boats are put through the sluice. Sometimes, when
the dam is high, some of the river-drivers go through
in the boats&mdash;a dangerous practice, this; for often
the bateaux have gone under water, entirely out of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
sight, to come up below the falls, and more than once
have lives been lost in this foolhardy feat.

THROUGH THE SLUICE.&mdash;A DANGEROUS PRACTICE THIS.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>A boom generally passes from three to six dams,
and sometimes takes four months to reach the mills.
</p>
<p>Occasionally the logs become jammed in the rivers,
and must wait for more water; if this can be supplied
from a lake above, the difficulty is easily remedied.
</p>
<p>In the spring of 1880, a jam occurred at Mexico in
Maine. The logs were piled forty feet above the water
and covered an extent of area as large as an ordinary
village. This great jam attracted visitors from all
parts of the country until the spring freshets of the
next year could supply the river with water sufficient
to loose them and bear them on their way.

<p style='font-size:smaller'>At the present time, July, 1880, the jam is still there. I saw the
driving and sluicing as I have described it, in May, 1880. It was very
interesting.&mdash;S. B. C. S.</p>
